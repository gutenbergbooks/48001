<p>The Doctrine of Physiognomy,
as attempted to be established
by the ingenious <span class="smcap">Lavater</span>,
may, in frequent instances, appear
chimerical; but there is a
Physiognomy, the rules of which
are always true, and whose evidences
are of service to morality.
The deformed Passions, disagreeable
in their appearance,
and dangerous in their consequences,
are of a character that
may be easily understood, and
the features of ugliness so faithfully
described to the pupil, as
to cause him to avoid vice, since
it has such frightful representations
as would make him hateful
to himself and to others, and
in consequence prefer those Passions
which bestow on the countenance
the beautiful and placid
features of a good and quiet
mind.</p>

<p>When it is considered, that in
the indulgence of the good or bad
Passions of the Human Mind, depends
the happiness or misery of
mankind, I shall not be accused of
having chosen a subject beneath the
province of my pen; I shall, on the
other hand, have my fears even of
being unequal to the task. I indulge,
however, a hope, that aided
by the talents of the inimitable
<span class="smcap">Le Brun</span>, I may be able to place an
inscription at least, beneath the
portraits he has so admirably delineated,
and which may have some
effect on the mind of the young
reader, who, when he observes that
the <em>best</em> people look <em>best</em> and most
happy, will be inclined to become
of the <em>best</em>.</p>

<h2 id="LECTURE">LECTURE
ON THE
<i>PASSIONS</i>, &amp;c.</h2>


<p>A few years ago, there lived a
gentleman, in the West of England,
whose name was Willock: he was
married to a very amiable lady, and
had five children&mdash;three boys and
two girls; the boys were named
John, William, and Henry; and the
girls, Caroline and Louisa. Mr.
Willock was possessed of a very
handsome fortune, but preferred a
country to a town life, as he was
very domestic, and his lady equally
fond of retirement. The young
people were brought up in the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of God, and of their parents; and
their dispositions were so good, that
it was very seldom, indeed, that
either their father or mother had
occasion to find fault with them; so
that perhaps there was not any where
to be found a more happy family.</p>

<p>Mr. Willock was very fond of his
sons and daughters; and, though he
was a man of learning and taste, frequently
indulged them with amusements,
which he had the goodness to
provide; but these entertainments
were always such as were blended
with instruction.</p>

<p>The <em>young persons</em> of Mr. Willock&rsquo;s
family were frequently visited by the
<em>young persons</em> of another family, the
sons and daughters of a Mr. Trevor,
who resided in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It happened one autumn, that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Willock had promised that he would
produce some new entertainment
for his young friends, as soon as the
evenings should begin to lengthen;
which intimation was not forgotten
by Henry, who was a very clever
boy, but rather too impatient.&mdash;Henry
eagerly watched for the evenings
getting longer; and an observation
which his father accidentally
made one day on the subject, was
enough for Henry: he went immediately
to his mother, who was seated
at the fireside at work, and whispered
her to remind Mr. Willock of his
promise, which was instantly understood
by all the rest of the young
people; and &ldquo;Do, mamma,&rdquo; was
repeated by one after the other. Mr.
Willock guessed, without much difficulty,
at what was going on, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
without saying a word, rose up and
walked to a table, on which was placed
his letter-case, out of which he took
a very handsome, small, red morocco
port-folio. John, William, Henry,
Caroline, Louisa, and the two young
visitors, were all at once engaged
in a very respectful manner, for they
did not say a word, watching Mr.
Willock, with their eyes sparkling
with pleasure and expectation. At
length Mr. Willock drew a chair,
and sitting down, told all the young
people to draw round the table, and
that he would shew them something
which would please them very much.
Henry&rsquo;s eyes were as bright as two
stars at this intelligence. &ldquo;What is
it, papa?&rdquo; was the next question.&mdash;&ldquo;This
book, my dears,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;contains some very curious en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>gravings,
the Portraits of the Passions
of the Human Mind, drawn by a very
great French artist, named <span class="smcap">Le Brun</span>;
but I will explain them to you as I
go on. Now then (continued he,
opening the book), the entertainment
begins.&rdquo; At these words, he
turned over one of the leaves, and
presented the portrait of</p>


<h2><a name="ATTENTION" id="ATTENTION"></a> ATTENTION. </h2>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; was now the general
exclamation among the young people,
while the eyes of all of them
were in an instant fixed on the same
object. &ldquo;Pray, sir, whose portrait
is that?&rdquo; cried John, the eldest boy.&mdash;&ldquo;That,
my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Willock,
&ldquo;is your face, and the face of all of
you at this moment.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed,
papa,&rdquo; cried Henry, &ldquo;you are only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
jesting with us; for I am sure that it
is not in the least like me.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well
then,&rdquo; said Mr. Willock, &ldquo;look at
your brother William, and tell me if
it is not like him.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, indeed,
papa,&rdquo; cried Henry; &ldquo;he makes just
such another face.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;True, my
dear Henry,&rdquo; returned Mr. Willock;
&ldquo;and so do <em>each</em> of you; because
this is the face of <em>Attention</em>, which
<em>each</em> of you show at this moment.
Only observe how the eyebrows sink
and approach the sides of the nose&mdash;how
the eyeballs turn towards the
object of notice&mdash;how the mouth
opens, and especially the upper part&mdash;how
the head declines a little, and
becomes fixed in that posture, without
any remarkable alteration&mdash;such,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;is the portrait of <em>Attention</em>,
drawn by Le Brun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But now, my dear children,&rdquo;
continued Mr. Willock, &ldquo;as I have
showed you the picture of <em>Attention</em>,
it will be proper that I should describe
the passion to you. <em>Attention</em>
is implanted in us by nature, as the
means by which we may become acquainted
with the objects of our
curiosity, and is a virtue, whenever
a proper object is selected. The
face is then always interesting, however
intent it may appear; but it is
the choice of a proper object which
can alone make this passion of value,
and truly estimable. <em>Attention</em> is
therefore either praiseworthy or not,
according to the object it selects.
Praiseworthy Attentions are chiefly
as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to the duties of religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> of children to parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> of young people to
their studies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to our friends and acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to the sick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to the duties of religion,
such as praying to God, and attending
the divine service, is not only
the most delightful <em>Attention</em> that can
be paid, but is of most advantage to
us, as by it we secure the blessing of
Providence upon our actions, and it
is only a preparation for the numerous
comforts we enjoy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> of children to parents
who have taken care of them from
infancy, being a proof of a grateful
mind, is always lovely and praiseworthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> of young people to
their studies is the only way for them
to acquire improvement, for without
it they must remain for ever in ignorance;
for instance, if, when I
shewed you this portrait, you were
all the time playing, or thinking of
something else, you could never
know what <em>Attention</em> meant, nor the
advantages to be gained by it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to our friends and acquaintance,
particularly to the aged,
is not only a duty, but shows our
politeness and good breeding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to the sick is required
from us by the precepts of religion,
and by the need we may some day
have for such <em>Attention</em> ourselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to business merely
consists in minding what we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
got to do, and is always rewarded
with profit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention</em> to dress is necessary,
as far as relates to cleanliness and
propriety, but no further; and you
will observe, that there are many other
Attentions which rank before it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is another <em>Attention</em>, which
may be called <em>Attention</em> to trifles,
which ought only to be paid when
there is not any thing more worthy
of our regard which ought to have
the preference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But as you have all of you been
so attentive, I will tell you a story,
which will show you the great virtue
and use of <em>Attention</em>,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles and George were twin
brothers, the children of Mr. Wilson,
a gentleman of small income, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
who had nevertheless given them an
excellent education. Both Charles
and George were boys of naturally
good dispositions; but Charles was
careless, and George thoughtful:
George always paid attention to what
was said to him, and Charles did not.
Charles was clever, and George rather
dull; but the attention which
George paid to his studies was so
great, that he presently got the start
of his brother. Charles was very
much astonished when he found that
George understood Latin better than
himself, and was not aware that his
deficiency was entirely owing to the
want of <em>Attention</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, when George and
Charles were both of them very
young, their father, who was a wise
and good man, made each of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
a present of a duplicate of this portrait,
with strict injunctions to keep
them safe, and to look at them often.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George had made a great many
friends when young, by the <em>Attention</em>
he was always disposed to pay
to his acquaintance, and particularly
one old gentleman, who was very infirm,
and who received his civilities
with great kindness; Charles, on the
contrary, as he did not care for any
one, so there were very few but his
parents who cared for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length George and Charles
were both of them sent into the
world, and placed in the counting-houses
of merchants of eminence,
who were friends of Mr. Wilson.&mdash;George
immediately began to pay
<em>Attention</em> to business, and Charles
was as <em>inattentive</em> as ever. George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was always employed, and Charles
did nothing but follow pleasure.
Now there is not any thing more
agreeable than amusement, when it
does not interfere with business; but
at the same time, there is not any
thing that can be more dangerous,
when it does.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a few years, Charles and
George were established in business
as Leghorn merchants, by the liberality
of their father, who left himself
but a very small income to live
upon. Mr. Wilson had, however,
the pleasure to see both his children
well circumstanced, and in a way of
making fortunes, before his death,
which happened shortly after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George paid so much attention
to his concerns, that he was already
in a way of getting rich; and, in ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>dition
to his own industry, he had
the pleasure to reap the benefit of his
kindness and attention to the infirm
old gentleman, who died about this
time, and left him his whole property.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles, during the whole time
of his being in London, had not visited
his brother more than three
times; and though George had frequently
called to see him, he never
took any notice of his kindness, but
altogether neglected him. Charles
was engaged wholly in folly and extravagance,
and was going on in a
very bad way; in short, his concerns
had been so mismanaged that he was
on the point of becoming a bankrupt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, Charles returned home
to his house, in great distress of mind,
as he had not been able to make up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
payment on which his credit depended.
He had occasion to examine his
desk to find some papers of consequence,
when, in his search, he happened
to lay his hand upon, and unrolled
the <em>neglected</em> gift of his father,
the portrait of <em>Attention</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles burst into tears when he
beheld the picture, and threw himself
in an agony of despair upon his bed,
when a letter was brought him by the
servant from an acquaintance, which
informed him that his brother George
was very ill. Charles, for the first
time in his life, felt that he had neglected
his brother, for the portrait
of <em>Attention</em> had made an impression
upon his mind. He arose immediately,
and went to the house of Mr.
George Wilson, but found that he
kept his bed: he was however ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>mitted;
and George, who had not
expected such a visitor, was nearly
overcome at the sight of his brother.
They embraced: and Charles, who
had happened to have heard of a
case similar to his brother&rsquo;s which had
been managed with great success by
his own physician, sent for him, while
he remained at the bed-side. In the
course of conversation, George inquired
very kindly after the state of
his brother&rsquo;s affairs, and told him,
that he hoped he was going on prosperously.
Charles, with a heart full
of pain, only gave evasive answers;
and on his brother&rsquo;s insisting that
something pressed on his spirits, took
his leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. George Wilson presently got
well by the advice of the physician,
who understood his case perfectly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and the very first thing that he did
was to call upon his brother Charles,
to thank him for his kind <em>Attention</em>,
which had been the means of restoring
him to health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George, having found the door
open, walked immediately towards
his brother&rsquo;s counting-house, when
he heard some very strong language,
and found his brother engaged in
conversation with one of his principal
creditors, who threatened to
make him a bankrupt, if he did not
immediately come to a settlement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George had been noticed by his
brother, and could see, in his turn,
that Charles was sensible that he had
heard every thing. George, therefore,
begged of the creditor to
acquaint him of the cause of his
treating a merchant of eminence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
with so little respect. The creditor
made answer, that payment had been
put off continually, and that he would
wait no longer. George requested
to know the amount of the debt,
which was five thousand pounds, and,
with a heart full of love and joy, sat
down instantly at the desk, and having
drawn a cheque on his banker
for that amount, put it into the hands
of his brother, saying at the same
time, &lsquo;My dear Charles, this is but
a small return for the kind <em>Attention</em>
you shewed me a few days ago.&rsquo;&mdash;The
creditor retired satisfied, and
Charles embraced his brother, while
the tears of gratitude for such a
timely assistance flowed from his
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George now desired to know the
real state of his brother&rsquo;s affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
which, after some difficulty, he was
prevailed upon to disclose, and which
were as bad as they could be. However,
such was the prudence and <em>Attention</em>
of Mr. George Wilson, that
he soon presented his brother with a
plan, by which, with <em>Attention</em>, he
might extricate himself. Charles,
thoroughly sensible of his brother&rsquo;s
advice, forsook his former propensities,
and paid the necessary <em>Attention</em>
to his affairs; when his difficulties
lessened by degrees; and at length he
had the pleasure to find himself out
of debt, and is now a rich man.&mdash;Thus,
my dear children, you see that
the very <em>first</em> mark of <em>Attention</em> of
Charles was blessed with a speedy
and successful return of good, and
led to prosperity. It was too much
to expect that he should reap as great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
a harvest as his brother, because he
had been wanting of the same industry;
nevertheless, as soon as he
determined to be industrious and
careful, he found that&mdash;To <em>pay</em> Attention,
is to <em>receive</em> Profit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young people had been extremely
attentive during the whole
time that Mr. Willock was relating
the history of George and Charles
Wilson, and seemed not only very
much pleased with the story, but
convinced of the truth of its moral&mdash;that
<em>to pay attention is to receive
profit</em>.</p>

<p>Caroline began now to show
some impatience to see the next picture,
and contrived to peep under
one corner, when she cried out, &ldquo;Oh
dear! what a beautiful face!&rdquo;&mdash;It
was</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ADMIRATION" id="ADMIRATION"></a>ADMIRATION.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 503px;">
<img src="images/p021.jpg" width="503" height="600" alt="ADMIRATION." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear (answered Mr.
Willock, turning over the leaf), it is
beautiful, because it expresses a good
passion, and one that is very grateful
to the mind&mdash;the passion of <em>Admiration</em>.
Do you recollect how delighted
you all were when you were
on the sea-coast, and saw the sun
rising above the horizon, and the
ships sailing before the wind? what
you then felt was <em>Admiration</em>. In
the passion of <em>Admiration</em>, the mind
is occupied with pleasing thoughts,
usually accompanied with love, esteem,
or veneration for the object;
and these sensations that give
such a pleasant turn to the features.
In this passion (according to Le
Brun), the eyebrow rises; the eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
opens a little more than ordinary;
the eyeball, equally between the eyelids,
appears fixed on the object;
the mouth half opens; and to this
disposition of features, astonishment
only exaggerates a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear children,&rdquo; cried Mr.
Willock,&ldquo;I would wish you, as often
as possible, to indulge this passion,
as it leads to many virtues.&mdash;<em>Admiration</em>
of the objects of nature brings
us to the contemplation of an almighty
God, who has filled the universe
with the innumerable wonders
of creation; and, indeed, it is the
whole work of <em>Admiration</em> to prove
our dependence on him, and his
great power and goodness; for it is
impossible, when we view the sun,
the moon, and the numberless stars,
the wide ocean, and the extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
landscapes covered with pasture, and
with herds and flocks, not to reflect,
how great and infinitely wise must be
the Author of all. This face of Le
Brun, you may observe, appears occupied
in some such contemplation.
It is almost the face of devotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us see, my dear children,
what then are the most worthy objects
of <em>Admiration</em>: They may be principally
classed,</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of the beauty and
order of the universe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of the power and
goodness of the Almighty, who created
all things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of the structure of
the human frame, of its strength and
powers, and of the animal world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of the goodness of
Providence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of the effects of
virtue, particularly of industry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of worth, of courage,
genius, talent, and of the works
of art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of the beauty and
order of the universe, is the first in
which we become engaged. We see,
you know, my dears, the same blessed
sun, the fountain of heat, light,
and life, return to us every day:&mdash;clouds
may sometimes obscure it,
but it soon appears again, to convince
us that its presence is ordered
by the Creator, to cherish the animal
world, and every plant and flower
that grows. If it is night, and we
view the stars, what can we conjecture
but that they must be placed in
the firmament by an Almighty hand?
and it is this reflection that occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
one of our poets, Dr. Young, to
say,</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>An undevout astronomer is mad</em>;&rdquo;
because he could not believe that any
person who had his senses would not
pause with Admiration, and adore the
Being who created these wonders of
the heavens. &ldquo;Go to the window,
my dear William,&rdquo; said Mr. Willock,
&ldquo;and look at them for a moment;
they have just begun to appear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William went to the window, and
all the rest of the young people followed
him. Mr. Willock named to
them some of the principal stars;
they were quite delighted; and when
he described to them the course of
the planets, and that for many thousand
years the same order had been
preserved, their faces showed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
disposition of features which belong
to <em>Admiration</em>.</p>

<p>After they had perused the stars
for a little time, Mr. Willock called
their attention again to the picture.
&ldquo;Let us now, my dear children,&rdquo;
said he,&ldquo;consider what must be the
power and goodness of the Almighty,
who created all these things; what
can we conceive of the hand that
could fix a ball of fire in the heavens,
of the magnitude of the sun?
but our <em>Admiration</em> increases when
we reflect, that it is that fire which
occasions the plant and the herb to
grow. You know, that in the winter
the ground is bare; but when
spring appears, and when the sun approaches
to us, it revives nature; and
the seed which has been sown may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
then be seen sprouting its green heads
above the earth: and the same source
it is which gives food to man. How
good is all this! and do you not
think that it calls upon us to be devout,
that is, to love God, and to
desire to follow his commandments,
that the Almighty, who has given us
so many blessings, may continue to
bless us with his Providence, in all
we do?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next object of our <em>Admiration</em>,&rdquo;
said Mr. Willock,&ldquo;is ourselves;
for as David says in the
Psalms, &lsquo;We are fearfully and wonderfully
made;&rsquo; and is it not true?
Observe, William, the formation of
the eye, the curious make of the fingers,
the strength of the muscles;
how the blood circulates through
your veins; and then the powers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
your mind; how you can think, how
you can reason upon what you hear
and see. Is not all this matter of
<em>Admiration</em>?</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; continued Mr. Willock,&ldquo;we
go a step lower, and survey the animal
creation, our <em>Admiration</em> will yet
be great: whether we examine the
mighty mammoth, the skeleton of
which you saw at the exhibition the
other day, or the little hummingbird,
which was shewn you at the
museum, still you must admire. It
is true, that we admire also the works
of man; but if we do, they will
only bring us back, after all, to think
of that great power which gave to
human beings such capacities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goodness of Providence
ought to be the next great object of
our <em>Admiration</em>, which has fixed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
such an order and regularity in the
universe, that it sheds a constant and
continual blessing and benefit on
mankind, by the rotation of the seasons,
by rains which water the earth,
and by an autumn sun to ripen the
corn, and give us a plentiful harvest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, in addition to this general
providence, which is for the benefit
of all mankind, the good, by whom I
mean those who love God, may rely
on a providence that will guard, protect,
and bless them through the day.
Therefore, when you rise in the
morning, pray sincerely for that
protection, and you may depend
upon having it. Judge Hale, who
was a very good man, used to say,
&rsquo;that he could always calculate upon
the successes of the next week, by
the attention he had paid to the du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>ties
of the Sunday; for,&lsquo; said he,
&lsquo;whenever I have passed that day in
admiration of the goodness of God,
and have prayed sincerely for his
assistance, I have always found success
to follow in my temporal affairs.&rsquo;
And this subject, he said, he had not
considered lightly, but had been convinced
of it from experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must not, my dear
children, if you have this reliance
upon the goodness of God, ever
doubt it, or give way to mistrust, although
you may meet in your future
life with crosses and vexations; because,
though you may meet with
them, if you have had such a dependence,
you may be sure they are for
the best, and because you cannot tell
what is the best for your own happiness.
God Almighty is your hea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>venly
father, as I may be your father
on earth; and he loves you with the
same care, only with more knowledge
and <em>power</em> to bless and protect you.
Now it may have happened, that
when you have wished to take a walk
in a warm summer&rsquo;s day, that I may
have forbid it, and that you may have
been, of course, greatly grieved and
disappointed; but when in the cool
of the evening I have invited you to
taste the refreshing air, you have been
much better pleased; you have discovered
my reasons for having forbid
it before; that then it was ill timed,
that you might have over-heated
yourselves, and have caught cold;
that it would be more pleasant in the
evening, and that I could then spare
time to accompany you. Think then,
my dear children, how much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
should you yield to the disappointments
God Almighty may place in
your way; and when they happen,
make yourselves happy with the best
of all comforts, that it is from his
goodness. Besides, when you come
to read more of history, and to grow
up, and notice the changes that take
place in the lives of your acquaintance,
you will find, that what appears
as the severest misfortune, may be
the means of bringing great good.
You remember the history of Joseph,
in the Bible; and pray recollect
that beautiful story through life. Joseph&rsquo;s
brethren, you know, who envied
him, conspired against his life;
but his brother Reuben said, &lsquo;<em>do not
let us kill him</em>:&rsquo; however, they cast
him into a pit in the wilderness, and
left him. Now their belief was, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
he would perish; for they never
thought that their cruelty would be
the very cause that would bring him
to great honour and preferment.&mdash;And
it is thus that the evil designs
of the wicked are made to produce
good, instead of harm, to the very
objects of their hatred. You recollect
that a company of Ishmaelites,
coming from Gilead, with the camels,
bearing spicery, and palm, and
myrrh, which they were going to
carry down to Egypt, bought him of
his brethren, drew him out of the
pit, carried him away with them, and
sold him to Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh, and a captain of the guard.
God Almighty inclined Potiphar to
show kindness to Joseph, and he advanced
him: but a second, and greater
misfortune was to happen to Jo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>seph,
to produce him still greater
good. He is falsely accused by Potiphar&rsquo;s
wife, and thrown into prison,
where was also the butler and baker
of Pharaoh. God supplies him with
wisdom to interpret their dreams;
he is sent for by Pharaoh, and gives
him counsel; the king promotes
him, and makes him ruler over his
house. But a yet more extraordinary
work of Providence was to be
performed; Joseph was to be the
means of saving the lives of his brothers,
who had conspired against him.
There was a great famine in the land
of Canaan, where his father and brothers
dwelt; and Jacob sent his ten
sons to Egypt for corn; but as he
had loved Joseph, and was afraid some
mischief would happen to Benjamin,
he did not send him with them; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
was, however, asked for by Joseph,
who pretended not to know his brothers,
and whom they could not recollect
in his greatness. They were
sent back for Benjamin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure that you recollect in
what manner Joseph entertained his
brothers on their return; that he forgave
them in his heart; that he relieved
them from the horrors of famine;
that the only rebuke he used,
when he parted with them, was of
the most gentle kind&mdash;&lsquo;<em>See that you
fall not out by the way</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear children, reflect
upon this history, and how many
times Joseph appeared to have cause
to complain of the hardness of his
lot; and yet it all led to honour and
promotion; and this should teach
you to do the best you can, in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>soever
situation you may be placed,
and to depend on God, who is the
great object of your <em>admiration</em>, for
the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next deserving objects of
our <em>admiration</em> are the effects of virtue,
and particularly of Industry.&mdash;Virtue
never fails to give blessings
to mankind; thus it is, that the good
are always the most happy. Industry
has the same blessing attending
it, and the recompence is of the most
delightful nature, as it gives the means
of acquiring many comforts, and
the power of doing a great deal of
good. Your mamma can tell you a
very pleasant story of the good effects
of industry, over indolence, or
despair.&rdquo; At this intimation, all the
young party directed their eyes to
Mrs. Willock, and&ldquo;Pray, mamma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
do oblige us,&rdquo; was repeated by two
or three of them at the same time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willock, who was not only a
very elegant and well-educated woman,
but extremely good-natured,
smiled at the eagerness of her young
friends, and began</p>


<p><i>The Story of the Two Gardeners.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;There were two market gardeners,
who were also neighbours,
and lived somewhere near the village
of Hammersmith. It happened, that
the early crops of peas, raised by
these two poor men, were in one
morning killed by a severe frost.&mdash;One
of the gardeners, a very short
time afterwards, having occasion to
pass by the gate of his friend, called
in to condole with him on their mutual
misfortune. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; cried he to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the other, &lsquo;how unfortunate have we
been, neighbour! do you know that
I have done nothing but fret ever
since my disaster: but, bless me,
what is here? you have a fine healthy
crop of peas saved from the frost.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Not
so,&rsquo; cried the other.&mdash;&lsquo;What
are they then?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; returned
the other gardener, &lsquo;these
are what I sowed immediately after
my loss.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What, coming up already?&rsquo;
cried the fretter.&mdash;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Bless
me, how is that?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Why,
while you was fretting, I was working,
that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What, and don&rsquo;t
you fret when you have a loss?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;To
be sure I do.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well, how then?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Why,
though I do fret, I always put
it off until after I have repaired the
mischief.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Lord, why then you
have no occasion to fret at all.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
&lsquo;True,&rsquo; replied the industrious gardener,
&lsquo;and that is the very reason,
the less one frets, the better.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure, my dears, that I need
not tell you the moral of this little fable,
because I am <em>sure</em> that you have
all of you good sense enough to find
it out: but as you may like to hear
it from me, I will tell it you&mdash;<em>That
the pleasantest reflection you can have
of a misfortune is, that you have been
able, by your industry, to repair it.</em>
And it is really astonishing, my dear
children,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;how many
mischiefs might be <em>repaired</em> by a
little trouble and industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of worth, courage,
genius, talent, and of the works of
art, is the next of which,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Willock,&ldquo;we have to
speak. <em>Admiration</em> of worth is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
among good minds, very grateful,
for they are always pleased to find
excellence; and in this country you
may indulge the passion at any time,
by reading the works of great authors,
such as Locke, Addison, Sir
Richard Steel, Doctor Johnson, and
others, wherein you will have to admire
an excellent moral, and a pure
and elegant language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of courage is another
pleasant sensation, though attended
with a portion of pain. It
was this kind of <em>Admiration</em> which
was felt by Philip king of Macedon,
when his son Alexander seized hold
of the bridle of Bucephalus, who was
so wild and unmanageable, that no
one had been able to mount him, and
softly letting fall his cloak, threw
himself upon his back in one leap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and animating him with his voice, put
him in full speed, to the astonishment
of every one present. Philip,
with tears of joy and <em>Admiration</em> in
his eyes, exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;My son, seek
a kingdom more worthy of thee, for
Macedon is below thy merit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Admiration</em> of genius and talent
may be often indulged. The many
curious pieces of mechanism that
may be seen daily, are objects worthy
of <em>admiration</em>; but perhaps the
most extraordinary of any to a
young mind is a ship, when it is
considered, that within its space
several hundreds of persons traverse
immense oceans, and sail to places
many thousand leagues distant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like very much to go
on board a ship,&rdquo; said Henry, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
his father had paused a moment to
take a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend,&rdquo; answered Mr. Willock,
"that you and your brothers
shall go to-morrow on board the
Rainbow man of war, the captain
of which is my particular friend: and
if you do, I think your faces will
express something more than simple
<em>Admiration</em>. Suppose we look at
the next picture; will not your looks
be more like it than this? for (said he,
as he turned over the leaf) it is</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may observe, that the motions
which accompany this passion
are more lively and stronger marked,
the eyebrows more elevated, the
eyes more open, the eyeball further
from the lower eyelid, and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
steadily fixed; the mouth is more
open; and all the parts in a much
stronger emotion; but, lest you
should be too much inclined to stare
and gape, I will tell you a story of
two schoolfellows, which is</p>


<h3><i>The History of Bill Vacant and
Henry Hawk&rsquo;s-eye</i>.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Bill Vacant and Henry Hawk&rsquo;s-eye
were schoolfellows of much about
the same age. Henry Hawk&rsquo;s-eye
was a clever, intelligent boy, who
was always seeking after knowledge,
and taking great pains to acquire it.
When he saw any thing new or curious,
he was not contented with
wishing that he knew what it was,
but he always set to work seriously
to find out every thing about it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
if it was a piece of mechanism, how
it was made. Bill Vacant, on the
other hand, always looked as if he
was very deeply engaged in thought,
when the truth was, that he was not;
all the time, thinking of any thing at
all. Bill Vacant was always wondering;
he would wonder two or three
times a-day what a clock it was?&mdash;what
he should have for dinner?&mdash;whether
it would be fine on the morrow?&mdash;whether
he should go to see
his grandmother at Christmas? or
something equally uninteresting. If
he saw any curious piece of workmanship,
he would wonder how it
was made, but would be satisfied with
wondering; his mouth therefore was
always wide open with <em>Astonishment</em>,
but was never filled with instruction,
which he would not be at the pains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to gather: his was not &lsquo;<em>The fond
attentive gaze of young Astonishment</em>,&rsquo;
mentioned by the poet Akenside,
who wrote a charming book, which
you must read some day, called &lsquo;The
Pleasures of the Imagination.&rsquo; Bill
Vacant was always gazing, it is true,
but to very little purpose; he was
not only ignorant, but likely to continue
so all his life; and so it turned
out; for Henry Hawk&rsquo;s-eye having
reflected that his father was not rich,
and that he would have to get his own
living in the world, bent his thoughts
towards a profession, and fixed upon
the law. Henry was presently a
student in the Temple, and paid so
much attention to his studies, that
he very soon became much resorted
to to draw pleadings; and it was
not many years before he made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
handsome fortune. Bill Vacant,
whose friends also had nothing to
give him, was all this time wondering
what would be the best line that he
could embark in; but as he was ignorant
of every thing, he found it
so difficult to determine, that day
succeeded day in slothful idleness.
One instant he would commence
merchant; the next he would go to
sea; then he would volunteer his services
in the army; in either of which
lines, if he had had perseverance,
he might have in a measure succeeded.
The truth was, that poor Bill
Vacant was always wondering what
would be the best for him, when, in
fact, he had better have taken up
any thing than have wondered any
longer about it. However, unhappily
for him, he continued wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>ing
all his life; and when he was old
and poor, all that he had to wonder
at was, that other people had succeeded
in the world so much better
than himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such,&rdquo; my dear children, &ldquo;is
the difference between <em>Admiration</em>,
and that void of thought which occasions
us to wonder without a desire
of improvement. Never, therefore,
lose your time in wondering; but
the instant you are at a loss to know
any thing, inquire and study till you
find it out, and master it. You may
sometimes be led wrong, notwithstanding
all your care; but do not
grieve although you may; for a
steady sure friend, called Experience,
will step in to make you full amends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was now an interval between
the entertainments Mr. Willock had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
promised his children, for tea and
coffee were brought in, with fruit;
when, after taking each a cup of tea,
and some strawberries, the young
people retired to rest, highly gratified
with the entertainment of the
evening.</p>


<h3><i>The Party to Weymouth.</i></h3>

<p>The next day presented a fine clear
sky, and the young people were told
to get themselves in readiness to go
in the barouche to Weymouth; but
Mrs. Willock being rather indisposed,
was not of the party. There is not
any thing more pleasant than the preparation
in these cases; all was bustle
and expectation. They were to
go on board a ship&mdash;what a delightful
excursion!</p>

<p>At length the time arrived&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
were at Weymouth&mdash;they saw the
ships at anchor&mdash;nay more, they saw
the king and royal party going on
board the yacht. The ships were
manned; the water was as smooth as
milk. Mr. Willock had taken care
to carry with him, for the amusement
of the young people, the Passions
of Le Brun, which he took out of
his pocket as they were going on
board the Rainbow, in the captain&rsquo;s
barge, that had been sent for them.</p>

<p>Henry was delighted&mdash;&ldquo;Only, sir,&rdquo;
said he to his father, &ldquo;look what a
number of men in blue jackets and
white trowsers are standing upon the
sails!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Those people, my dear,&rdquo;
said he,&ldquo;are our gallant defenders,
our brave English tars; they do not
stand, as you call it, on the sails, but
on the yards, to which the sails are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
fastened, or bent.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Dear sir,&rdquo; interrupted
William, &ldquo;what beautiful
boat is that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That, my dear boy,&rdquo;
said he,&ldquo;is the barge in which is
our dear sovereign, King George the
Third. There he is!&mdash;do you not
see him?&mdash;Here (said he, opening
the book of Passions), look at this;
this expresses the sentiment you
ought to feel; it is</p>


<h2><a name="VENERATION" id="VENERATION"></a>VENERATION.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 479px;">
<img src="images/p051.jpg" width="479" height="600" alt="VENERATION" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Veneration</em> is (according to Le
Brun) the result of admiration and
esteem, when it has something for
its object divine, beyond our comprehension,
or majestic in virtue.
The face is modestly reclined; the
eyebrows bent down; the eyes almost
shut and fixed, and the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
gentle, humble, and full of respect.
Who is it that must not feel the passion
of <em>Veneration</em>, at the name even
of our beloved sovereign, eminent
as he is in virtue, and mild and merciful
as he is on the throne? No
wild acts of ambition, no base perfidy,
no lawless stretch of power,
has dishonoured his reign. He is the
father of his people, and he has the
affection and <em>Veneration</em> of every
good man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The barge now approached the
side of the ship, which was manned,
that is, the seamen stood on each side
to hand the side-ropes (which were
covered with red baize) to the company;
and Mr. Willock was received
on the quarter-deck by captain
Manly, who commanded the Rainbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>A Description of a Man of War.</i></h3>

<p>Captain Manly, who was a very
well-bred man, received his guests
with great politeness, and gratified
their curiosity by taking them all
over the ship. He showed them the
fore-castle, which is the fore part of
the deck; the main deck, the gally-fire,
and the coppers wherein the sailors&rsquo;
dinner is cooked; from thence
he took them down the hatchways, to
show them the midshipmens&rsquo; births;
and between decks, where the hammocks
are slung, and the cable tiers,
where the cables which hold the ship
are coiled, or as you would call it,
laid round; and the bread-room,
where the provisions are served out.</p>

<p>Captain Manly next took his visitors
into his own cabin. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
refreshment was prepared, and among
other things, he gave them some real
salt junk, that is, salt beef, and
some sea biscuit instead of white
bread, which the sailors, with great
contempt, call <em>soft tommy</em>. He gave
them also some grog, as well as wine.
They then returned to the quarter-deck,
when John, William and Henry
amused themselves with the young
midshipmen, some of whom were
old schoolfellows, and showed them
how to go aloft up the shrouds (called
by the landsmen rope-ladders)
into the mizen-top, whither they followed
them a little way, but did not
like climbing to get over the top rim,
nor did they choose to go through
<em>lubber&rsquo;s hole</em>, which is a way of more
safety, used by landsmen, for fear
they should be laughed at. Henry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
however, expressed a great inclination
to go to sea; and on hearing
captain Manly relate to his father
the gallant achievements of Lord
Nelson, his eyes sparkled with the
love of glory. Captain Manly showed
his guests a picture of his gallant
friend; and the passion of <em>Veneration</em>
was again visible in every face.</p>

<p>One of the quarter-masters (who
are old seamen, and have the care of
the quarter-deck, and whose duty it
is to call the officers to their watch,
to turn the hour-glass, and go to the
belfry to pull the bell-rope) was
very attentive to the young gentlemen,
and took them forward, where
some of the sailors were dancing
hornpipes on the main deck, to the
music of a broken fiddle, played by
an old black fidler. The young peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>ple
gave the quarter-master (whom
the sailors called Old Spun-yarn)
some money to drink their healths;
and he, in return, got one of the boys
who waited on the midshipmen to
go aloft, and stand upon the truck of
the top-gallant-mast-head, which is
at the very greatest height of the
masts, where he stood on a space not
larger than the top part of a dumb
waiter, and drew in the pendant, and
let it out again at pleasure. John
and William shuddered to see him at
such a tremendous height; but Henry
seemed very much delighted at the
boy&rsquo;s activity.</p>

<p>The boat was now manned, at the
request of Mr. Willock, to put them
on shore; but as the wind had sprung
up, the water had got rather rough;
and before they had rowed far, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
strong gale came on, when the boat&rsquo;s
crew were obliged to pull very hard
to make the shore; and as the tide
run strong, they were some hours
before they could fetch, that is, reach
the pier. During their passage to
shore, the boat shipped several seas,
and the young people began to be a
little frightened, except Henry, who
seemed more stout-hearted than any
of the rest. Mr. Willock, for his
part, was only uneasy on account of
the delay it occasioned, and the apprehensions
which would occur to
the mind of his good lady. At
length, however, they were all landed
safe on shore; and after taking
a glass of wine, Mr. Willock set out
for home, where he arrived late at
night. It had now become quite
tempestuous, and Mrs. Willock and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
her little daughters were waiting
with the most painful anxiety. Presently,
however, the carriage was
heard at a distance on the road, and
the gates were thrown open by the
servants, before the bells could be
rung. Mrs. Willock, who was a most
affectionate mother, ran into the hall
to meet and embrace her children;
and Caroline and Louisa ran to kiss
their brothers, followed by all the
servants in the house. The family
were now all together, in the large
parlour, where was a good fire, and
all the comforts of home prepared
for the travellers. When they were
a little composed and refreshed, Mr.
Willock drew from his pocket the
Passions, and asked the young people
if, when they came in, they had
not seen a face like the one he shew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>ed
them? when they one and all
cried out, that it was mamma: the
truth was, that it was the passion of</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 476px;">
<img src="images/p059.jpg" width="476" height="600" alt="RAPTURE." />
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Willock,
&ldquo;it was the face of your dear mamma,
and never better expressed; full of
gratitude to God, and veneration for
that Almighty providence which conducted
you home in safety, her eyes
were directed towards heaven, her
mouth was only opened to breathe
a prayer of thankfulness, and the
two corners were a little turned up
with an expression of joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rapture, my dear children,&rdquo; said
Mr. Willock,&ldquo;is the most extatic of
the passions; it is a sentiment full
of love, joy, esteem, and veneration;
it is an excess of pleasure, and is fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>quently
too much to be borne; when
so, it is relieved by tears; you will
feel it sensibly, if ever you live to
have children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the <em>Rapture</em> your dear mother
shewed at your safe return, you
may do more than guess at how much
she must love you; you will, I am
sure, be grateful for so much tenderness
and affection, and never do any
thing that can give her pain. Thank
God that we are once more happy
together; and let us go to our beds
full of that sentiment, and to-morrow
morning, at breakfast, you shall
entertain your mamma with an account
of your voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning, at breakfast,
our happy domestic party met together,
refreshed, by undisturbed
rest, the repose of love and peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry related to his mamma all the
particulars of their naval excursion
the day before, which he concluded
by saying, that he should like very
much to go to sea, when Mr. Willock
mildly interrupted him&mdash;&ldquo;My
dear Henry,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do not make
your mamma uneasy by saying so.
If it is proper and suitable to the
views in life which we have for you,
your inclination will be studied;
and if it is not, I am sure that you
have too much good sense, as well
as love for your parents, to wish for
any thing that they might disapprove.&rdquo;&mdash;Henry
blushed a little, and
said, &ldquo;Indeed, sir, I will never think
of any thing that you or my mamma
may disapprove.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That is spoken
like a very good and sensible boy,&rdquo;
answered Mr. Willock: &ldquo;but,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>he, &ldquo;suppose that we return to the
Passions of Le Brun, and see whether
his faces will speak (for faces often
do speak by strong expressions of
the features) on the subject.&rdquo; He
opened the book, which lay on the
table, and the first portrait which
presented itself was</p>


<h2><a name="DESIRE" id="DESIRE"></a>DESIRE.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;">
<img src="images/p061.jpg" width="487" height="600" alt="DESIRE." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! how sharp the man
looks!&rdquo; said Henry.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried
Mr. Willock,&ldquo;you will observe that
this passion brings the eyebrows close
together, and forwards the eyes,
which are more open than ordinary;
the eyeball is inflamed, and places
itself in the middle of the eye; the
nostrils rise up, and are contracted
towards the eyes; the mouth half
opens, and the spirits being in mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>tion,
give a glowing colour. <em>Desire</em>
is most frequently unreasonable; it
often pants after things which are
improper, or hurtful to itself. Just
now, when you expressed such an
ardent wish to go to sea, your face
had all the expression of <em>Desire</em>.&mdash;Now,
my dear Henry, we should never
desire any thing, without due
consideration of its value, or of the
propriety of having it as we wish;
for instance, you should have
thought, &lsquo;It cannot matter much to
me whether I spend my days on
board of a ship, or on shore among
my friends; whether I am brought
up to the law, or whether I go into
the army; each of these situations
have their advantages and their honours;
they have, too, their labours
and disappointments. I know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
my parents would sooner study my
inclinations than their own: but
then they do not decide from inclination;
they are wiser, and have
more experience than me, and they
judge coolly, and without <em>Desire</em>,
what would be most fitting for me,
according to all the circumstances
of my education, the shew of my
talents, and the fortune I may have
to set out with in life. It is the novelty
of a sea life which gives it attraction;
but novelty soon ceases to
engage, and decreases in value, the
longer we make our visit to it; and
then we afterwards wish that we had
attended to something better for us,
or more adapted to our situation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are, however, many praiseworthy
objects of <em>desire</em>, such as</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <em>Desire</em> to please God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A <em>Desire</em> to improve in learning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <em>Desire</em> to excel in virtue or
science, properly called emulation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first of these ought to be the
great object of our lives: the second
will be a lasting delight and profit
to us; it will always secure us a portion
of respect in the world, and
will stay by us, though by misfortune
we should be stripped of all,
and left to work for our bread: the
third is a passion which makes the
great man and the hero; it made
such a statesman as Charles Fox, of
whom you have heard speak, and
such a hero as Lord Nelson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With these desires in your
breast, poverty will stand no chance
of keeping you under. The world,
my dear children, is like a market-place,
where many different persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
bring their wares, their industry, and
their trinkets for sale. Those who
have the best articles, or who are the
best workmen, will find the readiest
and most certain sale and profit or
employ; those who have more humble
talents, or wares of a worse quality,
are obliged to wait longer, and
sell for less; and such as have only
trinkets to offer, find customers only
by chance, and are never sure of a
market. Last of all, the lazy beggar,
who only comes into the market-place
in expectation of getting a
subsistence from the more industrious,
as he has nothing to offer in
exchange, meets little or no attention,
and hears only the just reproof
of &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get some work
to do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are several objects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
<em>Desire</em> that must never be entertained,
and which are very bad and
wicked; among these are</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Desire</em> of wealth, when unreasonable
or unconscionable, called
Avarice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Desire</em> of obtaining any advantage
of another unfairly, called
in the scripture, coveting our neighbours&rsquo;
goods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Desire</em> of being great or
ambitious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are others, which are those
forbidden by the Ten Commandments,
and of which I need not
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Desire</em> of wealth, called Avarice,
is a most extraordinary passion,
as it defeats the very end which it
wishes to produce, an enjoyment of
the rational pleasures and comforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of life; for the miser lays up hoard
upon hoard, and still remains unsatisfied;
he punishes himself continually;
he submits to the derision,
the reproaches, and contempt of the
world; he has no enjoyments, no
friends; and, besides, he suffers constant
dread and apprehension of
being robbed of his guineas: he
suspects every body. Such a character
we have in</p>


<h3><i>The Story of Old Alvarus, the Miser.</i></h3>

<p>&ldquo;Alvarus was an old miser, who
constantly kept his guineas in a bag,
which he used to hide in the most secret
place he could find in his apartments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alvarus had been so careful to
lay by his store where no person
would be able to find it and rob him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of it, that he <em>forgot</em> where he had
put it himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alvarus searched every hole and
corner that he could think of, without
success: the bag was not to be
found; but he knew that no one
could have taken it from him, for
not a creature had entered the house.
Alvarus fumed and fretted himself
ill; he went to his bed alone and
disconsolate, for very few cared for
Alvarus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length it happened that some
one knocked at the door of his hut;
Alvarus could not rise to open it;
but he called out, &lsquo;Whoever you are,
lift up the latch and come in, for I
am sick.&rsquo; It was his little nephew
Nicholas, whose father and mother
were poor industrious people, and
who had often asked Alvarus to spare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
them a trifle, to put them into some
little way of business, to make their
way in the world; but he had always
refused them: he would not part
with a sixpence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The father and mother of Nicholas
had, nevertheless, sent him to
inquire after the health of his uncle:
he was a fine little boy, with the colour
of the carnation upon his cheeks,
and with a brave open countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old man surveyed him from
head to foot. &lsquo;What, Nicholas,&rsquo;
cried he, &lsquo;is it you? How are your
father and mother? I am ill, Nicholas,
very ill.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas asked if he could do
any thing for his uncle? Alvarus
began to reflect, &lsquo;I might as well,&rsquo;
said he to himself, &lsquo;have no wealth,
if I am to suffer illness without help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
or relief, and I shall perhaps die for
want of medical assistance; yet who
can I trust to seek for this money?&rsquo;
He looked again at Nicholas; he saw
honesty in his face&mdash;&lsquo;This boy,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;knows nothing of the world.
I think that I need not be afraid to
trust him. Nicholas, my dear Nicholas,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;I wish that you
would seek for an old bag, which
you will find in some corner or
other; it is heavy, but what is in it
is not of <em>much use</em> to any body, and
you must not look into it upon any
account.&rsquo; Nicholas answered in a
very artless manner, that he would
not look into it for the world, if his
uncle forbid it. &lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; said
Alvarus, &lsquo;go and look all about, and
in every corner, as I have occasion
for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas, who was a very clever
and persevering lad, searched place
after place, until at length, in a dark
hole under the sink, he found the
bag, and carried it immediately to his
uncle. Alvarus was quite delighted,
when he saw the bag unopened&mdash;&lsquo;That
is a good boy,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;now
then go for the doctor, and tell him
to come to me, for that I am very
sick indeed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas ran all the way for the
doctor, and when he returned, it was
but reasonable to expect that old
Alvarus would have given him a trifle
of money; he however contented
himself with giving him only thanks;
and Nicholas was going home when
the doctor entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor felt the miser&rsquo;s pulse,
and found him in a very bad way&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
&lsquo;I am afraid it is too late,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;I should have been sent for before.&rsquo;
He moreover told Nicholas that his
uncle could not be left. Nicholas
therefore promised to return, as soon
as he had made his father and mother
acquainted with the situation
he had left him in; but the miser absolutely
forbid him to bring them
with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alvarus grew worse; the doctor
gave him medicines, but in vain;
when he thought it proper to tell
him, that there were no hopes of his
recovery, and advised him to settle
his affairs without delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alvarus was very much affected
at this news&mdash;&lsquo;What,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;have
I been laying up hoard upon hoard
only to leave it behind me? what
enjoyment have I had? what delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
has this world afforded me? I have
been poor in the midst of riches, and
have starved in abundance. I might
have been happy myself, and I might
have made others happy; I have neglected
the opportunity; and before
I have tasted refreshment, I expire
on my journey.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor asked the old miser
again about his affairs&mdash;&lsquo;If I die,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;I leave what little I have
to this boy, my nephew Nicholas.&rsquo;
The doctor took his leave, and Alvarus
addressed his nephew as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Nicholas,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;take
care of this bag for me; I shall fall
asleep presently, for I feel heavy;
there is not any thing worth having
in it; <em>it is full of rubbish</em>; nevertheless,
some people would be base

<p>&ldquo;Alvarus went into a sleep, from
which he never awoke again&mdash;Nicholas
called to him&mdash;he did not
answer. Nicholas run for his father
and mother&mdash;they arrived, but the
miser was no more. Nicholas told
them the story of the bag, which
they opened, and found full of guineas.
The doctor confirmed the
story of Nicholas, and that the property
was his right. The father and
mother of Nicholas shed tears at the
death of Alvarus; nevertheless they
said, &lsquo;How good and wonderful is
Providence! It appeared only by
chance that our son should happen
to go on that day to inquire after
his uncle, who had then mislaid his
treasure. Providence has put it in
its proper channel. Let us bury
Alvarus with respect, and mourn not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
so much that he is dead, as that when
living, he had never enjoyed life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas succeeded to the wealth
of his uncle, which was improved
by the industry and care of his parents;
and from being a poor lad,
Nicholas is now an opulent farmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That old miser was a very foolish
old man,&rdquo; said William, as soon as
Mr. Willock had concluded the story.
&ldquo;Certainly he was,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Willock;&ldquo;he might have made himself
very comfortable, and yet have
laid by sufficient to keep him far
from the dangers of want in his old
age; and that shows, my dear children,
the difference between prudence
or economy, and avarice:&mdash;prudence
allows all reasonable enjoyments,
but no extravagance or
waste; and as the articles of plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
wholesome food, refreshing drink,
and neat decent cloathing, do not
require any great sacrifice of money,
and are proper for us, and as good
management makes us as frugal as
possible, we cannot be much the
poorer for those reasonable indulgences;
and all beyond, it is wise
and necessary to lay by; out of which,
we ought, nevertheless, to spare a portion,
such as we can afford; to the
distrest. It is then that our prudent
hours are blest by Providence, and
the motive approved by the same Almighty
who has taught the ant to
provide for winter; and indeed old
age, my dear children, may properly
be called the winter of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will now,&rdquo; said Mr. Willock,
&ldquo;consider the nature of the <em>Desire</em>
by which men wish to obtain any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
thing unfairly, or what is called coveting
our neighbours&rsquo; goods.&mdash;There
is not any <em>Desire</em> that can be
more base or wicked than this, and
it leads to the greatest crimes; if ever
you feel it in your bosoms, which I
trust you never will, check it, my
dear children, as being base, mean,
unfair, unjust, and beneath your natures;
and be assured, that it is a
<em>Desire</em> which in the end will never
have success, as it is contrary to the
commands of God, and below the
honour and dignity of the human
character. Your dear mamma can
relate to you a very pretty story of
the ill-success of such a <em>desire</em>, as well
as of the folly of being too good-natured.&rdquo;
Mrs. Willock, finding the
eyes of all her little family imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>diately
turned towards her, began as
follows:</p>


<h3><i>The Story of the Two Merchants and
the Black Pebble.</i></h3>

<p>&ldquo;In the city of Peristan, which
is a province of Cashmeer, in Hindostan,
lived a merchant, named Baizeed;
he was a very good young
man, but was so generous and prodigal
of his money, and so very
good-natured, that any body might
get it from him; and the patrimony
he had received from his father was
almost spent. As Baizeed was walking
one day through the streets of
Peristan, he met an old man, with a
small bag in his hand, who accosted
him, and asked if he would choose
to buy any pearls or precious stones?
Baizeed had the curiosity or <em>desire</em> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
look at them; and the old merchant
seated himself under the portico of
a house, where he displayed his
goods. Baizeed looked at them one
by one; but his attention was chiefly
taken up with a small black pebble,
which had on it some marks of gold,
resembling in form the rays of the
sun. Baizeed inquired particularly
about this stone, which the merchant
told him was of considerable value,
though it only appeared as a common
black pebble; that it was a talisman,
invented by the magician Mahoud;
and that in all cases of extremity or
danger, it would give the owner the
most faithful counsel of the good
genii. Baizeed, on this, laid the
pebble down, giving up all thoughts
of purchasing it, as he supposed
its price to be infinitely out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
reach. &ldquo;I do not wish to inhance
the value of the pebble,&rdquo; said the
old man; &ldquo;I only ask fifty gold mohurs
for it.&rdquo; Baizeed assured him
that he could not afford to give him
half that money for it, and was going
away, when the old diamond
merchant stopt him&mdash;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
he to Baizeed, &ldquo;as you have taken
such a mighty fancy to the pebble,
you shall be welcome to have it on
credit, and pay me when you may
be able.&rdquo; Baizeed on this thanked
the old man as politely as he could,
and accepted the stone from his
hands, when the old merchant explained
to him some characters which
were on it, in the Hindoo language,
and formed the following sentence&mdash;&lsquo;<em>The
rays of wisdom.</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baizeed, on his return home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
shewed the pebble to his wife Aseecha,
and was very eager to invite all
his friends to shew them also the
purchase he had been so lucky as to
make, and invited them to a feast
for that purpose. When Baizeed&rsquo;s
friends were met together, one examined
it carefully, another liked its
curious appearance, and a third wished
him to make an immediate experiment
of its virtues. Baizeed
was not long waiting an opportunity.
One of his neighbours being engaged
in a lawsuit, was very anxious
to know what he should do in the
affair, and intreated him to try the
effect of the magic pebble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baizeed took a small flint in his
hand, and, upon striking it against
the stone, at the first blow, the liquid
fire came forth from it, and running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
upon the ground, immediately formed
the sentence of &lsquo;<em>Truth</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The counsel which the talisman
gave was attended to by the neighbour
of Baizeed, and by following
which, he got well through his difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Numerous were the applications
Baizeed received from different persons
to lend them the black pebble;
and all his friends were so kind, and
appeared so grateful, that he could
not find it in his heart to refuse them;
but what was the most extraordinary
was, that although Baizeed was thoroughly
sensible of the virtues of
the pebble, he scarcely ever made
use of it himself, but it was always
at the service of others, without any
return or recompence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In about three or four years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
after Baizeed had come into possession
of the pebble, what with neglecting
his own affairs, and attending
to the frequent solicitations of others
about theirs, Baizeed began to find
himself very much reduced in circumstances;
and in addition to this
folly of attempting to oblige every
body, he was naturally of a gay and
cheerful disposition, and was constantly
giving entertainments, for
the sake of having the society of
his friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among others who had the free
use of the talisman, was a neighbour
of Baizeed&rsquo;s, named Daoud, who had
always been welcome to his house,
and who he had done every thing to
serve; in short, Daoud had as much
use of the pebble as himself; he had
it upon every occasion he wished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and always smiled so graciously, and
professed so much friendship to
Baizeed, that it was impossible to
refuse him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baizeed&rsquo;s wife Aseecha loved
her husband very much, and frequently
entreated him to be more
careful of the valuable treasure he
had, and to turn the magic pebble
to advantage; but unhappily he neglected
her counsel; and at length,
what with the waste of time, and
seeing company to show off the talisman,
his situation became desperate;
when he thought it best to call
on his friend Daoud, to explain to
him his circumstances, and to consult
what was best to be done, as he was
afraid his creditors would take the
pebble from him. Daoud begged
him not to despond, and assured him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
that he would take care of the talisman,
if he was afraid of any mischief
happening to him. Baizeed put the
stone in his hands, requiring him, in
the most solemn manner, to make
use of it for his wife and family;
offering him, at the same time, a reasonable
share of that valuable treasure
for his trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daoud promised to do according
to the wishes of Baizeed, who retired
to a small village near the fountain
of Shookroach, whose waters bestow
peace, leaving Daoud in possession
of the talisman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baizeed waited many days patiently,
in hopes of seeing his friend
Daoud with a supply of money, for
his wife Aseecha was very distressed,
and his children had had nothing to
live upon but a small bag of rice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and a few dried fishes, which were almost
gone. Daoud, however, never
came near Baizeed; and presently
he was informed that he had got
into his house, and had made himself
acquainted with all his friends and
creditors, and that he was turning the
talisman to his own advantage solely.
Baizeed began now to blame his
folly, for having intrusted the only
valuable he had left to so sordid a
wretch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baizeed went to Daoud, to complain
of his ill treatment; but that
wicked wretch insisted he owed him
more money than the pebble was
worth; and Baizeed was too poor to
get redress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length, when Baizeed had
given himself up to despair, and was
sitting at his door in a pensive atti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>tude,
he saw the old diamond merchant
who sold him the pebble approach.
Baizeed was quite distressed
what he should say to him; but
thought, very properly, that the
truth was the best; he therefore
told him the whole story of his imprudence;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried the old
man, &lsquo;you have suffered sufficiently
for your good-nature; though you
have lost the talisman by your folly,
the good <a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>Bramah will not punish
you too severely. Come with me,
and we will go disguised as two
<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>Calenders to the house of Daoud.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baizeed prepared to follow the
old man; and at length having procured
the dresses of Calenders, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
set out on their journey, and arrived
at the house of Daoud, as he was
seated at the head of his table, feasting
with the great men of Peristan.
The Calenders, according to the custom
in the East, were invited to take
refreshment; and Baizeed seated
himself at the lower end of the table
of his perfidious friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After dinner, Daoud began to
speak of the virtues of the talisman;
and the Viceroy of the Sultan Shahabeddeen,
who was present, was
desirous that he should display its
wonders before him. Daoud called
for the pebble, and struck it with the
flint; but the liquid flame did not
issue from it; he tried again and
again; but it was all in vain. The
Viceroy, who considered that Daoud
had imposed upon him, was highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
incensed; and ordered his black eunuchs,
who were in waiting, to inflict
the punishment of the bowstring.&mdash;It
was in vain that he supplicated;
the Viceroy commanded that he
should die, unless he could, within
ten minutes, produce the sentence
of truth from the talisman. Daoud
attempted once more, but all was
fruitless, when the old man took up
the pebble, and striking it with the
flint, the flame immediately issued,
and formed a sentence on the ground&mdash;&lsquo;<em>I
am useless to the wicked.</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this, the Viceroy, who was
the more enraged, demanded to know
of Daoud the history of the talisman,
and how he came by it? That wicked
wretch, however, told a lie to
excuse himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Viceroy was so dissatisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
with the answers of Daoud, that he
demanded of the old Calender that
he should obtain again the sentence
of truth: The old man obeyed, when
the talisman produced the words&mdash;&lsquo;<em>The
saying of Daoud is not true; I
belong to Baizeed</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Baizeed, at the desire of the old
man, now threw off the dress of the
Calender, and confronted the wicked
Daoud, who being unable to say a
word in his defence, was instantly
strangled by the eunuchs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Viceroy ordered the pebble
to be restored to Baizeed, who returned
home, transported with joy
at having found his precious talisman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as Baizeed entered the
door of his house, he endeavoured
to obtain the sentence of wisdom
from the magic pebble; but it only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
produced the words&mdash;&lsquo;<em>I am useless
to the imprudent</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baizeed was again in anguish and
despair, when the old man entered,
and told him that the virtue of the
talisman would not return to it again
until he had, by hard labour, rubbed
the pebble so bright, that the rays
which had disappeared should again
become visible. Baizeed bore this
disappointment very patiently, and
returned home to his wife Aseecha,
when he set to work every day rubbing
the pebble, but no rays appeared.
At length, after a little time, he began
just to see a glimpse of them,
and by persevering, they were once
more restored. Baizeed now summoned
his friends to a feast, at which
they appeared again very readily;
but when they required the counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of the talisman, Baizeed demanded
from them a recompence for the benefit
they would receive; in consequence
of which, he got several
large sums of money; and having
found the old man, offered to pay
him the fifty gold mohurs, when the
old merchant said, &lsquo;I am richly repaid
by your being sensible of the value
of the pebble. My son, the mighty
Bramah is well pleased when he observes
in his children an ingenuous
heart, and kind disposition; but dangerous
even is the love of our fellow
creatures, if we are weak enough to
yield to the sweet voice of deceit.
Baizeed was tried with the magic
pebble, and he squandered away its
blessings. The wicked Daoud, whose
imagination was at work to obtain
the goods of Baizeed, was made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
instrument for punishing thy weakness;
but he was to become an example
also, that vice never prospers.
The magic pebble lost its power in
his hands, and the object of his covetousness
was the cause of his death.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the old man spoke, Baizeed
observed that rays of celestial flame
surrounded his head, and that his
garment was changed into a robe of
the purest white. The place was
filled with the fragrance of myrrh,
aloes, sandal-wood, the jessamine
flower and the rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baizeed fell prostrate on his
face; it was the good genius Zemrud,
who had appeared as the old merchant.
&lsquo;Blessed,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;are the
good, and powerful are those who
trust in Bramah.&rsquo; With these words
the genius disappeared, and Baizeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
returned home to his faithful Aseecha,
satisfied of the goodness of Providence,
and resolved never again to
forfeit the blessings of the talisman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>desire</em> of being great, or
what is called ambition, is laudable,
as long as the means resorted to to
satisfy it are just and fair, and it is
then a blessing; but becomes a curse,
the instant we have recourse to base
or improper means.&mdash;But,&rdquo; said
Mr. Willock, &ldquo;let us see what is the
next picture. What have we here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a very pleasant face,&rdquo; said
John.&mdash;&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Mr. Willock,</p>


<h2><a name="JOY" id="JOY"></a>JOY with TRANQUILLITY.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;">
<img src="images/p095.jpg" width="469" height="600" alt="JOY with TRANQUILLITY" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;You will observe here, that very
little alteration is remarked in the
face of those who feel within themselves
the sweetness of <em>Joy</em>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
forehead is serene; the eyebrows
without motion, elevated in the middle;
the eye pretty open, and with
a laughing air; the eyeball lively
and shining; the corners of the
mouth turn up a little; the complexion
lively; the cheeks and lips
red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Joy</em> is a delightful sensation, and
gives health to the body as well as to
the mind; when we feel joyful, with
what alacrity, what spirit, do we
move and act! It is <em>Joy</em> that you
taste of, when the time arrives for
you to return home from school, to
see your friends in vacation. When
<em>Joy</em> is felt, the mind is occupied with
every thing that is pleasant; all care
is for the time obliterated from your
recollection; you jump, and dance,
and sing, and spring about like young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
fawns, from place to place. But
this is not <em>Joy with Tranquillity</em>, like
that in the picture. <em>Joy with Tranquillity</em>
is more lasting, and is less violent.
I will attempt to describe the
passion to you by an example.</p>


<p class="hangingindent"><i>The Story of Matthieu and Gerrard,
the two Fishermen, who each found
a treasure.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Two fishermen, named Matthieu
and Gerrard, who lived in a small
village near the Mediterranean, and
who had each of them large families,
and were very poor, were out one day
drawing their nets, when one of
them, Gerrard, called out to the
other, that he had drawn ashore a
small casket, which was extremely
heavy; and he begged the other to
assist him to force it open, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
found it full of precious stones, carefully
inclosed in cotton. The fisherman
who had found the treasure,
very fairly and justly told the other
that he should go shares; and overjoyed,
ran home directly to his wife,
to tell her the good news. The other
fisherman, who was older and more
careful, staid to put his nets in order
before he followed, and was very
kindly doing the same office for his
friend, when he discovered another
casket among the meshes of the net,
which his comrade had overlooked,
full of the like treasure, and which
he put in his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the old fisherman returned
to the village, which was no great
way from the sea-shore, he found
the house of his comrade surrounded
by people. In short, poor Gerrard&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
rapture had occasioned him to tell
every creature he met of his good
fortune, and they had followed him
in a mass. One gave him a piece of
advice; another put in a claim for
favour; a third offered to get him a
market for the diamonds of a friend.
In short, he was almost torn to pieces
by the officious kindness of his neighbours;
and in his perplexity, he sold
his treasure for less than half its value,
to an old Jew, who, on hearing
the news, had hastened all the way
from Marseilles to the spot, to make
a good bargain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old fisherman said nothing
about his luck until night, when he
was at supper with his wife; and she
being a prudent woman, though she
felt a great deal of joy that her dear
children would be better cloathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and fed, yet it was <em>Joy with Tranquillity</em>.
They neither of them suffered
their good success to run away
with their reason. It was therefore
determined between themselves, that
Matthieu should go the next day to
Marseilles, where dwelt a respectable
Armenian merchant, and get a fair
price from him for the precious
stones he had had the luck to find.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day, the old fisherman
set out on his journey, without saying
a word to any body, and returned
home laden with louis d&rsquo;ors, in addition
to the small sum which was the
moiety of what the other fisherman
had honestly shared with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a very few months it happened,
that the younger fisherman,
Gerrard, owing to his excess of joy,
which made him insensible of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
he was about, and the folly of his
young wife, who spent a great deal
in dress, while he was giving, lending,
and throwing away his money,
was reduced at length to poverty, and
had nothing left to do but to take
to business again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was lamenting one morning
not having sufficient to purchase nets,
and was mending the old ones to go
out a fishing, when his neighbour
Matthieu came to the gate. &lsquo;I
thought,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;that you had
left off fishing, and that you lived
upon the interest of the money you
got for your pearls and diamonds;
or, perhaps, you are going out for
pleasure.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Alas,&rsquo; cried Gerrard,
&lsquo;it is not so; I have given away and
spent all that I had.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well, but,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;those you have done ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>vice
to will never let you want a little
money to purchase nets; they have
had plenty from you.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I have but
little hopes of them,&rsquo; answered Gerrard.&mdash;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said the old fisherman,
&lsquo;at any rate, give them the trial;
invite all these your neighbours and
friends to a feast, and after they have
regaled themselves, I will open the
whole business of your necessities,
and ask them to subscribe to put you
into business again.&rsquo; Gerrard followed
the advice of his neighbour,
and a feast was prepared, at which
every one took care to be present.
After dinner was over, the old fisherman
opened the business, and asked
each of them to subscribe a something;
but they had all of them an
excuse ready. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
&lsquo;in that case, I must do all by myself,&rsquo;
when he pulled out two large
bags full of louis d&rsquo;ors, which he
opened before them, and placed one
of them before Gerrard. &lsquo;Now,
sirs,&rsquo; said Matthieu, turning to the
guests, &lsquo;we will not trouble you any
further; <em>we shall not want your assistance
to count them out this time</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The guests departed one after
another, not a little chagrined at this
unexpected turn; and Matthieu explained
to Gerrard that the money
was his right; that he had kept it
for him, that it might not fall into
such bad hands as his former treasure.
All now was joy, but it was <em>Joy with
Tranquillity</em>; and Gerrard, delighted
with the wisdom, as well as with the
honesty of his friend, begged him to
keep it for him, and that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
draw for what he might have occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matthieu and Gerrard continued
neighbours and friends; their little
fortunes increased; and at length
their children intermarried, to the
satisfaction of the old people, who,
undisturbed by any excess of passion,
felt only <em>Joy with tranquillity</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! what a funny face!&rdquo;
cried Henry, as Mr. Willock turned
over the leaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, my dear,&rdquo; said he,&ldquo;the
face of</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laughter is produced by joy
mixed with surprise, the eyebrows
rise towards the middle of the eye,
and bend down towards the side of
the nose. The eyes are almost shut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and sometimes appear wet, or shed
tears, which make no alteration in
the face. The mouth, half open,
shews the teeth; the corners of the
mouth drawn back, cause a wrinkle
in the cheeks, which appear so swelled
as in some measure to hide the
eyes; the nostrils are open, and all
the face is of a red colour. Laughter
is at all times ungraceful, therefore
you will observe, that vulgar people
are most addicted to it: well-bred
persons manage this passion better;
they seldom do any thing more than
smile. Yet at times, it will happen
that something we meet with is so
truly ridiculous or comical, that we
cannot by any means help laughing.
There are, however, some persons
who are so much of idiots, that they
will laugh at the most trifling thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
in the world; of this description
were</p>


<h3><i>The Family of the Gobblegruels.</i></h3>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Gobblegruel, who was very
rich, had arrived at that title purely
by having done some service to the
government as a contractor. His
lordship had but very few ideas
beyond a common sum in arithmetic.
My lady Gobblegruel was just as ignorant,
only much more proud and
affected, though, to tell the honest
truth, she was originally his lordship&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a numerous family of
them. There was his lordship, the
right honourable lady Gobblegruel,
the honourable Master Thomas Gobblegruel,
and the honourable Miss
Boadicea Gobblegruel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>You will wonder, my dear children,
that there should be such characters
as these among persons of
rank; and the truth is, that, generally
speaking, in this country, persons
of rank are persons of education,
of good sense, and of elegant
and refined manners; yet here and
there, up starts a peer without politeness,
and a baron without brains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To proceed then&mdash;the honourable
master Gobblegruel was what
some coarse people would have called
a <em>natural</em>; at any rate, he most certainly
was a <em>natural curiosity</em>. Master
Gobblegruel&rsquo;s whole pleasure and
employment was driving pigs: and
to be sure, no salesman in Smithfield
market understood pigs better; he
could tell you whether a pig with a
curly tail was better than a pig who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
had not a curly tail, or than one that
had no tail at all; but what was a
more excellent accomplishment in
our little master was, that he could
squeak as naturally as that animal;
and which species of entertainment
being according to the taste of the
family, he was often called upon by
the right honourable lady Gobblegruel
to perform for the amusement
of the right honourable lord Gobblegruel
in the drawing room. (Henry
could scarcely refrain from laughing).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Gobblegruel was not only
one of the greatest idiots, but also
one of the greatest gluttons in the
world; he was formed very much
like a pig himself&mdash;I mean one that
was well fattened; for he was nearly
as thick as he was long; his cheeks
were so plump and round, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
almost hid his eyes, which were very
small; but master Gobblegruel had
another extraordinary accomplishment&mdash;he
could perform Punch to
the life, which he used to do in the
housekeeper&rsquo;s room, to great audiences
of the servants, and with prodigious
applause. It was really very
amusing to see the son of a nobleman
with a short stick in his hand,
knocking, as he pretended, his wife
Joan on the head, squeaking <em>toote</em>,
<em>toote</em>, <em>toote</em>, and nodding and winking
exactly like his famed original.&mdash;(Henry
could not resist <em>Laughter</em>
any longer).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The honourable master Gobblegruel
was so ungraceful at table, that
he disgusted every body; you might
see him take up the bone of a fowl,
which he would gnaw and suck with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
so much avidity, that the grease
would run down the sides of his
mouth, into which he would also
constantly put his knife instead of
his fork; and when he drank, you
might see the greater part of his face
through the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day in particular, master
Gobblegruel made a more than commonly
ridiculous figure; he had
got the end of a drumstick of a
fowl in his mouth, which upon being
reminded by some person present
was vulgar, he transfixed immediately
between his teeth, sitting bolt
upright, and grinning like his honourable
father&rsquo;s pug-dog, to the infinite
amusement of all the servants.
The young gentleman would not
however part with the bone. (Henry
burst into a fit of <em>Laughter</em>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must now,&rdquo; said Mr. Willock,
&ldquo;for the benefit of the young ladies,
describe the honourable Miss Boadicea
Gobblegruel, who in shape
and figure was the counterpart of her
honourable brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Boadicea never looked at
any thing; she always stared; she
was excessively vulgar, and was ignorant,
in spite of education. She
was, too, always laughing; and when
she did laugh, she might be heard
from the drawing-room into the
kitchen; nor was there half a note
difference between the laugh of Miss
Boadicea and the laugh of the cook-maid.
Miss Boadicea was nearly as
coarse in her manners as her brother,
but much more ill-natured and satirical.
Master Gobblegruel would
not offend any body, unless they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
spoke against pigs; and Boadicea
had a constant antipathy to
merit in distress, or meanness in apparel;
and though she sometimes
deigned to assist, it was always done
with the features of pity proceeding
from contempt: but let us have
done with this disagreeable monster;
I see, my dear Caroline, that you
already despise her. Another laughing
character calls our attention.&mdash;I
will describe him in the following
story.</p>


<h3><i>The History of Charles Banter.</i></h3>

<p>&ldquo;Charles was the son of a gentleman
of very moderate circumstances,
who had, however, found
means to send him to Eton College,
where he distinguished himself very
early, not only by being the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
scholar of his age, but one of the
best-natured boys. When Charles
was <em>fag</em>, he went through that service
without a murmur; he was always
as merry as a grig. If his
schoolfellows beat him, he only
laughed all the time; in short,
Charles was what they called a fine
fellow: but he had a very great
fault, and that was an inclination to
entertain himself continually with
that disagreeable amusement of
schoolboys, called <em>quizzing</em>; he used
to quiz the master, quiz the mistress,
quiz the inhabitants, and quiz
the strangers. Charles, therefore,
though he was admired as a clever
boy, was not loved, and indeed had
many enemies; for there are very
few people who like to be laughed
at. Charles Banter&rsquo;s propensity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
often attended with disagreeable consequences,
and was a grand obstacle
to his success in life. Charles was
at home one vacation, when a distant
relation, who happened to wear a
wig, was on a visit to his father.&mdash;The
old gentleman took particular
notice of Charles; and having no
children of his own, had left him a
very handsome fortune. Charles
ought, you will say, to have had a
little prudence, but he could not resist
the propensity to quiz. The
wig was the object of his amusement;
and he contrived one day,
before the old gentleman put it on,
to slip into his room, and pepper
and salt all the curls; so that when
he came down to dinner, he set the
whole party at table sneezing. At
length the joke was discovered; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
as nobody was present on whom the
slightest suspicion of such an indecency
could fall, except Charles, the
question was put to him, and the
colour in his face pleaded guilty;
in short, he confessed the joke; for
Charles, to speak fairly of him, disdained
to tell a lie. His father, who
was not a very sensible man, was indiscreet
enough to join in the laugh,
and to take no farther notice of the
affair. It was not so with the old
gentleman; he never visited the same
table afterwards, and to his will added
the following codicil:&mdash;&lsquo;To master
Charles Banter, for the seasoning of
my wig, <em>five shillings</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will see by this event, my
dear children, that it is your interest
as well as duty, to pay respect to age;
for old people can serve you by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
their experience, even if they have
not money to leave you; you may
fly to them for advice, and the attention
you pay them is <em>never lost</em>.
But there is a still worse character,
and that is him who enjoys mischief,
and who takes a pleasure in cruelty;
he laughs too, but his laugh is the
smile of malice. Such a wicked
character was Tom Worry, who was
the son of a gentleman, and who had
begun very early to make war against
the poor harmless animals and insects
who came unfortunately in his way.
To torment and to destroy was his
whole delight; and a poor innocent
cat was the particular object of his
cruelty; and, what is very extraordinary,
it was to the having hunted
one of these poor animals into a
cellar, that he owed all the <em>scratches</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
he afterwards received from ill-fortune;
for while he was amusing
himself in this way, he was joined
by a <em>vulgar</em> boy ten times more wicked
than himself, and who exulted
with him in the distress of poor
puss: this boy ingratiated himself
into his favour, prevailed upon him to
run away from his friends, led him into
a great many very serious scrapes,
and was at length his utter ruin.&mdash;Surely,
my dear children, we need
only to reflect for a moment on the
nature of the pain we inflict, to
turn from wanton cruelty: how
should we like to be hunted into a
corner, by creatures stronger than
ourselves, and pelted by them with
stones and dirt? we should think it
very hard usage. If any ill accident
assails, how altered are our features,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
how wretched, how distressed do we
appear, what agony do our features
express at the pain of a broken or
dislocated limb! Let us see if Le
Brun has described this sensation&mdash;yes,
here it is.</p>

<h3><i>The Mother and her little Family.</i></h3>

<p>&ldquo;A scholar of the University of
Basle, named Henry D&rsquo;Orange, and
who was the only son of the rich
Marquis D&rsquo;Orange, was riding one
day towards a small town, when, as
he approached, he observed a great
number of people gathered together,
at the end of a narrow street.
The scholar rode up to them, to inquire
into the cause of the tumult,
when one of the persons, an honest
shopkeeper, who happened to be
standing on the step of his door,
made answer, &lsquo;Ah, sir, a poor unhappy
woman is the cause of all this
disturbance.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;How so?&rsquo; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
scholar.&mdash;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; returned
the honest merchant, &lsquo;how
well this good creature deserves the
pity of the poor people who are
her neighbours, and who would willingly
go to the greatest extremities
to relieve her, did she not herself
forbid it, and entreat them not to
interfere with the course of justice.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I
cannot yet comprehend you,&rsquo;
answered the young scholar; &lsquo;what
has happened to her?&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Many misfortunes,
sir, one after another.&mdash;She
is a widow; she has six children;
she lost her husband after he
had been confined a year to his bed.
I think, sir, that I see him now; his
eyebrows drawn together; the eye
as if fixed on some object; the nostrils
raised, making a wrinkle in his
worn cheeks; the mouth half open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>ed
and drawn back; and every part
agitated in proportion to what he
suffered.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; cried Mr. Willock,&ldquo;the
picture.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p121.jpg" width="506" height="600" alt="SIMPLE BODILY PAIN" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But to go on with the story&mdash;&lsquo;So,
sir,&rsquo; continued the merchant,
&lsquo;the poor young man died; and in
about two months after that event,
his widow was delivered of her sixth
child. These misfortunes were on
the heels of each other; and the expences
of interring her husband
swallowed up the whole of her little
money. Her landlord, a man of a
hard heart, and cruel disposition,
would not give her time to pay a
twelvemonth&rsquo;s rent, which was in
arrear. It is only fifteen days since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>he told her, with the most savage
cruelty, that if she did not pay the
money in a few days, that he would
seize her furniture, and turn her into
the street. He has kept his word;
to-day the huissiers or bailiffs have
surrounded the house of this poor
woman, and have taken every thing,
even to the cradle of the poor innocent
at her breast. The neighbours
having found out what was going on,
assembled together immediately, and
would probably have soon put an
end to the power of these harpies of
justice, if this good creature had not
entreated them to desist. Ah, sir,&rsquo;
continued he, &lsquo;this is but a poor
place; we are all distressed here,
or she should not want assistance.&rsquo;
The young stranger listened to the
narrative with great attention, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
begged him to proceed. &lsquo;You may
judge, sir, how much this amiable
woman is beloved, and she deserves
it all. In her better days, she never
heard of distress without endeavouring
to relieve it; if any one of her
neighbours was sick, she was always
their nurse; and she attended to
these duties without neglecting her
aged father, who is still alive, though
near an hundred years of age, or forsaking
the attention due to her little
ones. During the lifetime of her
husband, who was a dealer in stuffs
from Marseilles, all that she could save
beyond what she thought superfluous
to their situation, she used to bestow
in charity upon her poor neighbours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry, who was so much affected
that the tears ran from his eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
now dismounted, and in an animated
tone desired the shopkeeper to
show him the way to the dwelling of
the poor woman. &lsquo;Conduct me,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;to the house of this respectable
widow, who deserves a
palace instead of a prison, and who
ought to find a protector in every
friend of humanity.&rsquo; Such was the
noble appearance of Henry, and the
generous expression of his countenance,
that the crowd instantly made
way for him to pass through to the
dwelling of the widow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry presently arrived at the
habitation of misery, and which had
been but a little time before the abode
of conjugal felicity. He was struck
with astonishment at the scene which
presented itself; he found the interesting
female, of whom he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
heard so much, surrounded by her
little ones, who were crying, while
she was endeavouring to console and
comfort them with every mark of
tenderness and affection, regardless
of her own distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us see, my dear children,
if we can find the picture of this
good mother. It is&mdash;it is the face of</p>


<h2><a name="SADNESS" id="SADNESS"></a>SADNESS.</h2>

<img src="images/p125.jpg" width="514" height="600" alt="SADNESS." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;See her full of anxiety and sorrow,
yet calm and resigned to the
will of Heaven. Notice the dejection;
the eyebrows rise towards the
middle of the forehead more than
towards the cheeks; the eyeball appears
full of perturbation; the
white of the eye is turned yellow;
the eyelids are drawn down, and a
little swelled; all about the eye is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>livid; the nostrils are drawn downwards;
the mouth is half open, and
the corners are drawn down; the
head carelessly leaning on one of
the shoulders; the face is of a lead
colour; the lips pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; my dear children,&ldquo;can
view this amiable countenance, without
feeling interested for the object,
a mother, and in sorrow&mdash;a mother
in want&mdash;a mother in despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor dear woman seems to
be without the most distant prospect
of relief; without the most remote
chance of meeting with a friend;
without means of extricating herself
and her little ones from ruin; yet
she ought not to despair, for <em>Providence,
when none appears, can find
itself a way</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were two of those un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>happy
beings in the world, whose
profits and enjoyments arise out of
the distresses of their fellow-creatures&mdash;two
huissiers, as they are
called in France, or what we call
sheriff&rsquo;s officers; yet these people,
my dear children, are necessary
in the community, to preserve property,
and to cause us to act with
justice to each other; and when their
unpleasant office is performed with
decency and mildness, they do not
deserve disapprobation. It happened,
however, that the two officers
who were in the poor widow&rsquo;s room
were of that description who debase
the very nature of man, by rapacity
and cruelty, and who, hardened by
constant scenes of misery, commit
every possible outrage on the distressed
and friendless.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;See them busily employed, taking
an inventory of the little effects
of the poor widow, with an unfeeling
composure, that disgraced even
their profession. Here is the portrait
of one of them, full of officious
consequence and contempt for poverty.
To the applications which are
made to him by the poor widow for
lenity, his hard inflexible features
present only the face of</p>

</div>

<p>and here are its lively and strong features.
The forehead wrinkled; the
eyebrows knit; the side of it next
the nose drawn down, and the other
side rising very much; the eye is
very open, and the eyeball is in the
middle; the nostrils rise and draw
towards the eyes, and make wrinkles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
in the cheeks; the mouth shuts, its
sides sinking down, and the under
lip is pushed out beyond the upper
one. With what detestation do we
view such a face as this!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scholar, mute with astonishment
and terror, was some time before
he addressed these harpies. He
gazed first at the widow, whose interesting
countenance engaged his
attention, then at the children about
her, and then on the officers&mdash;&lsquo;How
much, sir,&rsquo; cried he to one of them
who was writing at a table, &lsquo;does
the debt amount to?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I should
like to know what business it is of
yours,&rsquo; answered the bailiff, in a surly
tone, still continuing to write, without
deigning even to look at the person
who addressed him. &lsquo;You are mighty
curious,&rsquo; continued he; &lsquo;what busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>ness
is it of yours how much the woman
owes? I suppose that you wont
pay the money for her, will you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scholar&rsquo;s attention was now
taken off by a heavy sigh, which he
found proceeded from the breast of
an aged man, who was seated in an
old elbow chair by the fireside. It
was the poor widow&rsquo;s father, mourning
for her sorrows, and grieving for
her distress; for as far as respected
himself, he had but little care. He
was near eighty years of age. Here
is the countenance of the poor old
man; it is the face of</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;The alterations that <em>Weeping</em> causes
are very strongly marked. The
eyebrows sink down towards the
middle of the forehead; the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
are almost closed, wet and drawn
down towards the cheeks; the nostrils
swelled; the muscles and veins
of the forehead appear; the mouth
is shut, and the sides of it are drawn
down, making wrinkles in the cheeks;
the under lip, pushed out, presses the
upper one; the face is wrinkled and
contracted; its colour is red, especially
about the eyebrows, the eyes,
the nose, and the cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not a pity, my dear children,
that the latter years of a good old
man like this should be disturbed
with grief&mdash;that an old man should
weep? The young scholar thought
so too, for he sighed at this scene of
accumulated distress; but his attention
was soon awakened to another
object. One of the officers (for
they were determined to seize every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
thing in the room) took a little sleeping
infant from its cradle, and laid
it rudely on the floor, snatching away
at the same time the clothes on which
it had been laid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry was rouzed with indignation
at this brutal conduct, and stood
in need of all his moderation to prevent
his instantly giving the wretch
the chastisement he deserved; but
he restrained his passion, and contented
himself with throwing his
purse on the table, demanding again,
in a lofty tone, the amount of the
debt? The sight of the gold produced
an instantaneous effect on
the mind of the principal of the
officers, and which discovered itself
as promptly in his face; he replied
in a more civil tone, that ten louis
was the amount of the sum demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
for the rent and expences. Henry
ordered him immediately to prepare
a receipt, which he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the money was paid, our
young noble scholar exultingly <em>lifted
the little infant from the floor, and
replaced it in the cradle</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry stood a minute over the
child, which smiled as if conscious
of its protector&rsquo;s presence. Henry
surveyed its features as it lay. Let
us seek for his countenance at the
time. Are not these, my dear children,
his features? is not this the delightful
countenance, the beauteous
face of</p>

<em>Compassion</em>, causes the eyebrows to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
sink towards the middle of the forehead;
the eyeball to be fixed upon
the object; the sides of the nostrils
next the nose, to be a little elevated,
making wrinkles in the cheeks; the
mouth to be open; the upper lip to
be lifted up, and thrust forward; the
muscles, and all the parts of the face
sinking down, and turning towards
the object which cause the passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is indeed the portrait
of the scholar looking at the infant
in the cradle. What an assemblage
of the noblest sentiments of the human
mind produce <em>Compassion</em>&mdash;love,
tenderness and care for the object&mdash;self
is for the time totally forgotten.
How different, my dear children, is
this face from that of the surly
bailiff!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The officers now took their leave,
with each a servile bow, when the
poor widow, overcome by the kindness
and generosity of the young
scholar, fell upon her knees, and invited
her little children to do the
like, that they might thank God for
having sent an angel to their succour;
while the old man, who was
sitting by the fireside, lifted up his
hands in a silent prayer to Heaven,
and wept for joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young scholar embraced the
mother and all her little ones, among
whom he generously distributed the
remainder of the louis in his purse,
and then took his leave, promising
to see them again very soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry mounted his horse amidst
the acclamations of the people, who
had surrounded the house, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
heard of the way in which he had
employed his time. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dieu vous benira</i>,
&lsquo;God will bless you,&rsquo; was reiterated
from every mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young scholar kept his promise,
for he often visited the cottage
of the poor widow, and represented
her amiableness and situation in such
lively colours to the marchioness his
mother, that she took the whole family
under her protection, placed
them in a little way of business, and
helped them until by their own industry
they had made themselves
independent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, my dear children, was true
generosity. The object was worthy:
the donor had the means to make
happy; none were injured by the
gift; no just claims were left unpaid,
and a poor family were made happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This narrative will show you also,
my dear children, the power and
goodness of the Almighty, who, by
his Providence, ordered it so, that
what appeared to the poor widow as
her greatest misfortune should turn
out to be the very means of affording
her and her children a future
provision, and that much more ample
than she could have expected.
Thus, my dear children, &lsquo;<em>Providence,
when none appears, can find
itself a way.</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Willock had no sooner finished
his story, than he had the pleasure to
observe his young people occupied
in very serious reflections on what
they had heard. &ldquo;My dear children,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I am very much pleased
for the attention you have paid, and
for the interest you have taken in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the misfortunes of the good widow.
I shall leave you to enjoy the
thoughts of her good fortune, and
of the change produced in her affairs
by the generosity of the young
scholar. To-morrow evening, I will
tell you a story of another kind,
where I shall have to represent to
you some of the worst of the passions
of the human mind, such as
you will hate and detest, when you
see their ugliness and deformity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next evening Mr. Willock resumed
his office of lecturer, and was
fully attended by the young family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;going to
tell you a story, in which the passions
of horror, terror or fright, anger, hatred
or jealousy, and despair, will be
represented; it is called</p>

<h3><i>The Wicked Baron, and Nicholas the
Honest Wood-cutter.</i></h3>

<p>&ldquo;In the South part of the forest
of Dean, in Gloucestershire, there
lived, many years ago, a poor wood-cutter,
named Nicholas; he was not
more than thirty years of age, of a
handsome figure, lusty, and strong.
Nicholas was rough and sturdy as an
oak, but bent as tenderly to the tale
of distress as the gourd to the wind;
he was apt, it is true, to be a little
ill-tempered at times, and somewhat
sour; besides being a little rude and
unfashioned in his manners; but
somehow or other, so finely delineated
were the characters of nature
and truth in his mind, that the outlines
might be seen in his face, whenever
distress or misfortune claimed
his protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas had a wife named Gertrude,
and she was naturally a good
woman, though she would fret and
scold whenever they happened to be
poor, which was no uncommon case
with them: they had nothing but
hard labour to trust to for support,
and had a young boy to provide
for; besides, it unfortunately happened
for both of them, that Gertrude
was the daughter of a once-wealthy
farmer, but who had been
ruined by a murrain among his cattle.
Gertrude had therefore received
a little better education than Nicholas,
who could, however, read and write,
a great wonder in those days, and
which he owed, when a boy, to the
kind instructions of a good old
monk. Gertrude, who recollected
her father&rsquo;s happy board, was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
out of temper with her situation,
and so foolish, as to be constantly
wishing for riches, and pining after
wealth, which was never likely to
come to her share.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It happened one night, after
Nicholas had returned home from
work, and finding Gertrude cross,
that something like the following
conversation took place between
them; but, my dear children, you
must avoid this manner of speaking,
which is only used among poor country
people.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear, how ill-tempered you
are!&rsquo; cried Nicholas.&mdash;&lsquo;I may well
be ill tempered,&rsquo; replied Gertrude;
&lsquo;this is the last meal we shall have
this week.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That is more than you
know, my dear,&rsquo; answered her husband.&mdash;&lsquo;I
am almost famished, I am,&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
cried Gertrude.&mdash;&lsquo;Look at the poor
cat, and make yourself happy, my
dear,&rsquo; replied Nicholas.&mdash;&lsquo;Well,
there&rsquo;s your supper,&rsquo; cried Gertrude,
taking a small piece of meat from
the pot.&mdash;&lsquo;Supper do you call it,&rsquo;
answered Nicholas; &lsquo;why there&rsquo;s
scarcely enough to bait a mouse-trap:
but wont you take a bit, my dear?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I
shant touch any of it,&rsquo; answered
Gertrude, peevishly.&mdash;&lsquo;Well, for
my part,&rsquo; replied Nicholas, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll say
grace even for this morsel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas said all he could to put
his wife in a good humour, but was
not lucky enough to succeed. She
took it into her head that he was bantering
of her, and began to sob and
cry, reproaching him with bringing
her into poverty.&mdash;&lsquo;But it serves me
right,&rsquo; cried she. &lsquo;I might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
married a rich yeoman, so I might,
and have had plenty, that I might.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Shu,
nonsense,&rsquo; answered Nicholas.
&lsquo;To throw myself away upon a chopper
of wood,&rsquo; cried she; &lsquo;and there
too, we have had to bring up that
idle boy, because, truly, you found
him laid in the forest one night.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Now
don&rsquo;t say a word about that,&rsquo;
answered Nicholas, &lsquo;or I shall get
as ill-tempered as yourself, out of
mere good nature.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While the wood-cutter and his
wife were scolding in this way, some
one knocked loudly at the door,
when after some more words about
who should open it, Nicholas went,
and a stranger very elegantly dressed
entered the cottage. It was a tempest,
and the night very dark.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good people,&rsquo; said the stranger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
&lsquo;will you afford a traveller shelter
from the storm?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Willingly, sir,&rsquo;
answered Nicholas.&mdash;&lsquo;Very willingly,
sir,&rsquo; interrupted Gertrude; &lsquo;wont
you be pleased to sit down, sir?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stranger was the rich Norman
Baron de la Braunch.&mdash;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
cried he, &lsquo;Nicholas, how does fortune
use thee?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Roughly enough,
sir.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Heaven knows,&rsquo; replied Gertrude.&mdash;&lsquo;Who
told you to speak?&rsquo;
interrupted Nicholas. &lsquo;My wife,
sir, is always grumbling; she must,
forsooth, be longing after riches;
and though I don&rsquo;t remember, by the
goodness of Providence, that we
have ever wanted a meal, yet she is
always talking about starving.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ay,
ay, nobody knows what I suffer, I
am sure,&rsquo; replied Gertrude; &lsquo;I
might have married a rich yeoman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
that I might.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Come, come, good
people,&rsquo; cried the Baron, &lsquo;be better
tempered with each other: and do
you think, good woman, that riches
would make you happy?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That
they would, sir,&rsquo; answered Gertrude;
&lsquo;for rich folks can eat and drink
whatever they&rsquo;ve a mind to, and can
dress as they please; and then they
can feed ever so many poor people,
and can make ever so many folks
happy.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, ah, so they might,
wife,&rsquo; answered Nicholas, &lsquo;and yet
not be happy themselves, after all.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well
now, I can&rsquo;t see how that
can be,&rsquo; replied Gertrude. &lsquo;I am
sure I should like hugely to be rich,
and to have a castle, and forests, and
deer of my own, and plenty of servants.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And
you are quite certain that
you would be happy if you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
rich?&rsquo; repeated the Baron.&mdash;&lsquo;Yes,
sir,&rsquo; cried Gertrude; &lsquo;and I would
never scold my poor Nicholas any
more, for he is as good a creature as
ever was in the world, though I was
angry with him just now; and to
say the truth, I do not believe that
he could have got any more work
to-day if he had tried ever so; but
when one is poor, and there is no
meat in the pot, one is apt to be a
little vexed and cross.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas wiped his eyes at this
kind atonement of his wife Gertrude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Baron went into a deep
reverie&mdash;the storm was over&mdash;the
Baron arose, he pulled out a purse
and put it into Gertrude&rsquo;s hand, and
then wished them a good-night.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Nicholas offered to see him through
the forest, but he declined the offer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The instant the Baron had left
the cottage, Gertrude run to the
lamp to examine the purse; it was
full of gold coin. &lsquo;Blessed St. Anthony,&rsquo;
cried she, &lsquo;what is this? all
gold! Nicholas, look here; see
what Providence has done for us.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ay,
I told you so,&rsquo; answered Nicholas,
&lsquo;and you are always grumbling.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Nay
now, don&rsquo;t be cross,
Nicholas,&rsquo; said Gertrude, &lsquo;when
we&rsquo;ve had so much good luck; look
at it, Nicholas, &lsquo;tis all pure gold.
I&rsquo;ll have a new dress, and, I&rsquo;ll go and
wake poor Henry, and tell him that
he shall have a new coat.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And
what am I to have?&rsquo; cried Nicholas.&mdash;&lsquo;You
shall see us all clean and happy.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Thank
ye,&rsquo; answered the ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>nest
wood-cutter, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all I want.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And
we will have a good piece
of meat in the pot to-morrow,&rsquo;
cried Gertrude.&mdash;&lsquo;And I am sure
you wont sleep to night,&rsquo; answered
Nicholas.&mdash;&lsquo;That I shant,&rsquo; said she:
&lsquo;well, who knows what good luck is
to follow?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Peace, Gertrude,&rsquo;
cried Nicholas, &lsquo;may not this money
be a temptation?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;May it, Nicholas?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Who
knows?&rsquo; said Nicholas.&mdash;&lsquo;If
I thought so,&rsquo; answered Gertrude,
&lsquo;I would not touch it.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Come,
come,&rsquo; cried Nicholas, &lsquo;while
it don&rsquo;t make us covetous after more,
and lead us to do wrong, we shall
have nothing to fear. For my part,
I shall work the same as ever; but
don&rsquo;t grumble, Gertrude.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You
shall never hear a cross word from
me,&rsquo; answered Gertrude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus did these poor cottagers
end their discourse, and both sat
down to supper, pleased and happy;
but they could neither of them rest
at night for thinking of their riches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very different sentiments disturbed
the repose of the Baron; he
had arrived at the height of his ambition;
he was one of the richest
knights in the kingdom; enjoyed
a good fame, and had the favour of
the king: yet he was not happy;
he was a miserable wretch; the honesty
and dignity of a good mind
was wanting; he was restless and
disturbed in the possession of wealth,
and would almost have parted with
the whole of it, again to have been
innocent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, about a twelvemonth
after this time, Nicholas was at work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
in the woods, with his boy Henry.
A stranger had inquired for him at
the cot; Gertrude had directed him
to the place where Nicholas was felling
trees. On the stranger&rsquo;s approach,
he heard a man scolding&mdash;&lsquo;What,&rsquo;
cried he, &lsquo;do you think I
am to keep you for nothing, you
little lazy monkey? why don&rsquo;t you
get another withy, and bind up these
faggots?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I am at work, as fast
as I can,&rsquo; answered the boy, &lsquo;but
you are so cross. If you are tired
of keeping me, I&rsquo;ll leave you to-morrow,
and seek for support elsewhere.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Leave
me, that you shant,&rsquo;
cried Nicholas; &lsquo;I found you in the
forest one night, laid on the turf, a
poor helpless brat; humanity made
me take you in; and though I am
apt to be sour at times, I have enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
of the same humanity left to prevent
your ever being turned out.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You
have, indeed, been very kind to me,&rsquo;
answered the boy.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well, shake
hands, Henry,&rsquo; said Nicholas, &lsquo;and
think no more of what has past.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the stranger entered the
close, he addressed Nicholas&mdash;&lsquo;Come,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;you must leave off and go
with me.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Truly not I,&rsquo; said Nicholas,
&lsquo;for I have not quite done.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No
matter, thou must go to the
cottage. I have good news to tell
thee.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Nay, if that be the case,&rsquo;
said Nicholas, &lsquo;it is worth half a
day&rsquo;s work; so here&rsquo;s pack up.&rsquo;&mdash;Nicholas
proceeded with the stranger,
and the boy Henry followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On their arrival at the cottage,
Gertrude welcomed her husband
home, and prepared a place for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
stranger, who prefaced what he had
to say with some remarks on the extraordinary
changes and vicissitudes
of human life; and then inquired
if they remembered a stranger, of
more than common appearance, who
had visited them one stormy night,
about a twelvemonth before?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas and Gertrude both answered
him, and told him of the present
they had received from that
person.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; cried the stranger to Nicholas,
&lsquo;I know that thou art truly the
man whom I seek; prepare to go
with me to the castle of La Braunch,
thou, and thy wife and family.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Indeed,
sir, you&rsquo;ll excuse me there,&rsquo;
cried Nicholas; &lsquo;I shall not stir out
any more to-day.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Do not be
so obstinate,&rsquo; replied the stranger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
&lsquo;for know, that he who gave you
the money a twelvemonth since,
was the Baron de la Braunch.&mdash;He
is dead, and you are heir to all
his rich demesnes.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly
understand you,&rsquo; answered the wood-cutter.&mdash;&lsquo;The
castle, the lands, all
his real and personal estate, is thine.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;My
dear, don&rsquo;t you understand
the gentleman?&rsquo; cried Gertrude.&mdash;&lsquo;Not
I, in good faith,&rsquo; answered Nicholas.&mdash;&lsquo;Why,
don&rsquo;t you know that
you have come to be a rich man, and
that the rich Baron has left you all
that he was worth in the world?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It
is true, indeed,&rsquo; answered the
stranger; &lsquo;I am witness to the will.
When the Baron was dying, he desired
a scroll of parchment to be
brought out of his library: his order
was instantly obeyed&mdash;&ldquo;This scroll,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
said he, fixing his eye steadily upon
it, &ldquo;is my will. Thou wilt find,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;in the forest of Dean, a
solitary cottage, inhabited by a wood-cutter
and his wife. The name of
the wood-cutter is Nicholas; the
name of his wife is Gertrude. These
people are poor; they wish for
riches, and they <em>shall be</em> rich; they
shall be the heirs of the Baron de la
Braunch; who knows, perhaps to
them riches may be a blessing.&rdquo;&mdash;The
Baron affixed his seal to the
parchment, and soon after expired in
the arms of father Benedict.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried Nicholas, &lsquo;and what
will become of me? What can I
do with all these riches?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Do with
them; leave that to me,&rsquo; said Gertrude,
quite overjoyed.&mdash;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to be put out of my way,&rsquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Nicholas.&mdash;Poor Gertrude, in the innocence
of her heart, stopped the
mouth of her husband&mdash;&lsquo;Dear Nicholas,
do not affront the gentleman;
I am sure that I should like to be a
lady very much; and to be sure I
did think that there was something
very odd in the stranger&rsquo;s behaviour
to us that night, and took it into my
head that he would do something
for us, though to be sure I did not
think that he would die and leave us
all his wealth; but this gentleman
would not say so if it was not true;
so, Nicholas, if you must be a rich
man after all, why you must not
mind a little trouble.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied
Nicholas, &lsquo;if it must be so,
there&rsquo;s no help for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stranger had provided a
cloak, with a hat and a sword, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
which he accoutred the poor wood-cutter;
and also a decent robe, which
he threw over the shoulders of Gertrude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas would not go without
the boy Henry; so they shut up the
cottage, and set out together. It
was late when they arrived at the
castle; they were conducted to a
room provided for them, by the direction
of the stranger, who was the
Baron&rsquo;s esquire Hathbrand, when
having caused one of the wardrobes
of the Baron to be opened, he selected
such of the plainest dresses as
he thought would best become Nicholas,
Gertrude, and the young boy
Henry. Gertrude was, however, very
desirous of being fine, and was also
much pleased with the attention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Ranetrude, the waiting-woman appointed
to attend on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doric the old steward, Jonas the
butler, and all the rest of the servants,
were ordered to get themselves
in readiness the next morning, to
attend the reading of the Baron&rsquo;s
will, and to receive their new
master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The story was already spread
abroad, that the Baron had left his
immense wealth to a poor wood-cutter;
and numerous were the remarks
and low witticisms on the subject,
from old Doric, Jonas, and the
other servants, as they waited in the
hall, among the numerous tenantry
of the Baron, to hear the will read,
and to receive their new lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length Nicholas and Gertrude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
attended by Hathbrand the squire,
and Ranetrude, entered the hall.&mdash;Nicholas
saluted the domestics and
tenants without awkwardness, and
stept forward without dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hathbrand held the parchment
in his hand; he spoke&mdash;My friends,
peace be with you all; I here produce
the will of the late Baron de la
Braunch. Attend&mdash;&ldquo;Know all men,
that I the Baron de la Braunch, do
give and bequeath to Nicholas le
Blanc, of the forest of Dean, all the
real and personal estate of which I
now stand possessed, on condition
that he visits the third chamber in
the western turret alone, there to
unlock the chest which contains the
title-deeds, and that he never divulges
the secrets they will unfold.&rdquo;
The third chamber in the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
turret had not been used for many
years, as the eastern part of the castle
had been inhabited by the Baron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas ascended the western
turret alone, and after some difficulty
opened the door of the third chamber,
when he entered, and discovered
in a remote corner a large iron chest,
the key of which was hanging near
the entrance. Nicholas attempted to
open it; at length by an effort he
succeeded; he lifted up the lid, and
took out a large scroll of parchment.
Nicholas read&mdash;&lsquo;<em>The title of
the Baron de la Braunch to these demesnes
is murder!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas let fall the scroll, but
recovered it again; he run into the
gallery, and then stood motionless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, my dear children,&rdquo;
said Mr. Willock, &ldquo;let us find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>thing
like the face of honest Nicholas,
when he was reading how bad
a title he had to the riches bequeathed
him. Here it is, expressive of
his abhorrence of the crime, and of
the object who left him his wealth.
This is the face of</p>


<h2><a name="HORROR" id="HORROR"></a>HORROR.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/p159.jpg" width="512" height="600" alt="HORROR." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;An object despised, says Le
Brun, sometimes causes <em>Horror</em>; and
then the eyebrow knits, and sinks a
great deal more; the eyeball placed
at the bottom of the eye, is half covered
by the lower eyelid; the
mouth is half open, but closer in the
middle than the sides, which being
drawn back, make wrinkles in the
cheeks; the face grows pale, and
the eyes become livid; the muscles
and the veins are marked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But to continue&mdash;While Nicholas
was gone to the western turret,
refreshment was prepared in the hall,
and Gertrude and Henry waited
anxiously for his return to partake
of it with them. The honest old
steward and Jonas the butler had
not been sparing of expence on the
occasion: so that the entertainment
was as superb as if the Baron had
been alive. They had begun to
like their new master, who was a bold
generous fellow, and they were determined
to show him all the respect
and homage they could, notwithstanding
he had been a wood-cutter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were waiting in suspense
for Nicholas; presently his steps
were heard descending the stairs
quickly. He entered in great agitation&mdash;&lsquo;Gertrude,&rsquo;
was all that he
could say; his face was the face of</p>

<p>as represented by Le Brun. The
violence of this passion alters all the
parts of the face; the eyebrows rise
in the middle; its muscles are marked,
swelled, pressed one against the
other, and sunk towards the nose,
which draws up as well as the nostrils;
the eyes are very open; the
upper eyelid is hid under the eyebrow;
the white of the eye is encompassed
with red; the eyeball
fixes towards the lower part of the
eye; the lower part of the eyelid
swells, and becomes livid; the muscles
of the nose and cheeks swell,
and these last terminate in a point
towards the sides of the nostrils;
the mouth is very open, and its corners
very apparent; the muscles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and veins of the neck are stretched;
the hair stands an end; the colour
of the face, that is, the end of the
nose, the lips, the ears, and round
the eyes, is pale and livid. Such
was the face of honest Nicholas. He
fell into a chair, and let drop the
scroll.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Heavens! what ails my poor
Nicholas?&rsquo; cried Gertrude; &lsquo;speak,
speak to me, Nicholas.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Let us to
our cottage, Gertrude,&rsquo; replied Nicholas,
&lsquo;let us to our cottage!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What
ails you, my dear Nicholas?&rsquo;
said Gertrude, feeling his hand. &lsquo;Oh
dear, how cold!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Read, read!&rsquo;
said Nicholas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hathbrand took up the scroll,
and read&mdash;'<em>Know, thou who longest
after riches, that the title to these
estates is murder</em>; the infant heir to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
these demesnes was on Christmas
night, now fourteen years since, left
to perish in the forest of Dean.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; cried Nicholas;
&lsquo;read it again; as I live, the very
night I found our poor Henry.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;The
very night indeed,&rsquo; repeated
Gertrude.&mdash;&lsquo;Are you sure of this?&rsquo;
interrupted Hathbrand.&mdash;&lsquo;Most certain,
sir,&rsquo; replied Nicholas. &lsquo;I remember
the night very well; it was
bitter cold. Oh dear! oh dear!
this is all Providence! this is all
Providence!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas embraced Henry: Gertrude
embraced him also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry wept; he understood all
that was said; he took the hand of
Nicholas&mdash;&lsquo;Thou hast fed me,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;out of thy scanty pittance;
thou must not leave me, Nicholas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
I have no friend that I know of, but
my dear Nicholas.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicholas consented to remain in
a cottage near the castle, but refused
to be rich. Gertrude had no longer
any desire to be rich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hathbrand and the servants were
delighted to find their young master
so noble and gallant a youth, and
immediately did him homage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As they were speaking of these
surprising events, father Benedict
entered; he brought with him Hugo,
a wretch whom the Baron, in his
confessions, had accused of being
his accomplice, and who had left the
child to perish in the woods; he was
strongly guarded, but denied the
charge; he bid defiance to the power
of his accusers, and insisted that the
Baron had died in a state of insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely here are the features of
this bravo, full of defiance and resentment;
is it not the face of</p>


<h2><a name="ANGER" id="ANGER"></a>ANGER?</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">
<img src="images/p165.jpg" width="481" height="600" alt="ANGER" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The effects of anger shew its
nature; the eyes become red and
inflamed; the eyeball is staring and
sparkling; the eyebrows are sometimes
elevated, and sometimes sunk
down equally; the forehead is very
much wrinkled, with wrinkles between
the eyes; the nostrils are
open and enlarged; the lips pressing
against one another; the under
one rising over the upper one, leaves
the corners of the mouth a little
open, making a cruel and disdainful
grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Baron had, however, confessed
his own wickedness, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
cause of his cruelty towards the infant.
The facts were these. The
Baron Hubert, who was ordered to
Palestine, left his wife lady Bertha,
and his child Edward, under the protection
of his friend, the Baron de
la Braunch: lord Hubert was killed
in the crusade, and his lady died soon
after, leaving the infant under the
guardianship of the Baron, who
fearing that one day the child would
be likely to succeed to his father&rsquo;s
possessions, it became hateful to
him. The mind of the Baron was
set upon the wealth of his deceased
friend; he was constantly jealous and
disturbed at the sight of the infant;
he had laid a plan to destroy it.&mdash;What
a dreadful situation it must
have been to have had a mind like
his! When once such wicked ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
are entertained, there is an end of
all rest, of all enjoyment, and of all
comfort. The face represents the
storm that agitates the breast. It is
horrid even to look at it. How does
Le Brun describe it?&rdquo;</p>


<h2><a name="HATRED" id="HATRED"></a>HATRED or JEALOUSY.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;This passion wrinkles the forehead;
the eyebrows are sunk down
and knit; the eyeball is half hid under
the eyebrows, which turn towards
the object; it should appear full of
fire, as well as the white of the eye
and the eyelid; the nostrils open,
more marked than ordinary, and
drawn backward, so as to make wrinkles
on the cheeks; the mouth is so
shut as to show the teeth, and very
much sunk down; the muscles of the
jaw appear sunk; the colour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
face is partly inflamed, and partly
yellowish; the lips pale or livid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The infant was taken into the
woods by Hugo, where it was left
to perish; and the wicked Baron
soon contrived to persuade the domestics
that the child had died of a
fever; and had even a mock burial,
the better to deceive them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear children,&rdquo; said
Mr. Willock, &ldquo;if the former was
the countenance of the wicked Baron
before he committed the crime,
how did it appear now? instead of
finding that he could enjoy his riches,
his mind was full of horror and dismay;
his anguish became extreme;
his face appeared not only deformed
but hideous; the forehead wrinkled
from the top to the bottom; the
eyebrows bent down over the eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and pressing one another on the sides
of the nose; the eyes seemingly on
fire, and full of blood; the eyeball
disturbed, and under the eyebrows,
sparkling and unfixed; the eyelid
swelled and livid; the nostrils large,
open, and lifted up; the end of the
nose sunk down; the muscles, leaders,
and veins, swelled and stretched;
the upper part of the cheeks large,
marked, and narrow towards the jaw;
the mouth drawn backwards, more
open at the sides than in the middle;
the lower lip large and turned out,
he gnashes his teeth, foams, bites
his lips, which are pale, as is the
rest of the face; the hair is strait,
and stands an end; such was the
picture of the wicked Baron, the
picture of</p>

<h2><a name="DESPAIR" id="DESPAIR"></a>DESPAIR.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;What a dreary thing, my dear
children, must be despair&mdash;afflicted
by an accusing conscience, and bereft
of hope! What would this
wicked man have given, after he had
parted with his ill-gotten wealth,
to have found the child alive! but
that felicity was denied him living;
he was to die in affliction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wicked Hugo was taken to
prison to await his punishments.&mdash;But
let us turn to a more agreeable
subject&mdash;the honest wood cutter,
who could refuse all the allurements
of wealth, because it was ill-gotten;
even his wife Gertrude, who loved
riches, disdained to enjoy them on
such terms. What a lesson does this
afford to us to be noble in mind,
and to resist temptation! The good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
do not feel any of the violent passions;
they are moderate and temperate
in all they do; they are undisturbed,
and through all the changes
of life may depend on that Providence,
the recollection of which
occasioned the great and good Jonas
Hanway; who founded the Marine
Society, to use the motto&mdash;&lsquo;<em>Never
Despair</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, then, my dear children,
suffer your young minds to long
after riches, when they cannot be
purchased by fair and honest means;
for you may rest assured that it is
much better to prefer,</p>
